com.kiddoware.kidsplace,John 3:16,so far I'm loving the app. I was using the Kids Mode app at first but it came with games already downloaded within the game which I didnt like. I use the kids place app only when I want them to play on learning apps. This app helps me do just that! thanks,5

Since putting the home screen lock on I've had no issues as it just goes straight to kids place the second the iPad reboots or is turned on.

It lags and always has a popup about a kids safe browser. My kid is 3, I don't want her on the internet at all. Adding/removing apps is annoying and slow and under certain circumstances the app will only load a handful of your allowed games/content. You have to go back in, disallow them all and re-allow them to get them to show up again. Good concept overall",3

I go to put some new games on my daughter's tablet and I can't exit the app to get to the play store. It's acknowledging that it is the correct pin, It pretends that it's going to exit, then it won't exit. So I try to send an email for support and it won't do that from the app either. Okayyy. So then I change the settings to not come back on after a reboot. Well sure enough it comes back on anyway despite the change in settings. I changed the home screen setting to not come back on when you push the home screen middle button and after trying 15 times it finally randomly exits the ap. Yay! oh but the home screen button still brings me back. What? So I end up just trying over and over to exit and when it finally does I get to the settings and disable the app and delete it to finally get control of the tablet back. This app was behaving like a virus. Once the app was deleted the tablet started going faster too. If I had not paid for the subscription I probably would have just been annoyed and not written a review but I paid for this ya'll.",1

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,Lauren Whidby,Really good app. Been using it for years,5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,Klaudia Wosinska,I find this app great for keeping an eye on my kids but there is one thing I would like this app to have. When putting the apps/games into kids place you can't put them into folders to organise it a bit better for the kids. I find it overwhelming with so many apps (in the home place itself) not having their own folder.,4

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,James Bullock,"Works pretty decent for free, will even block adds from the play store....but, you seem to still be able to hear them. The plug-ins don't seem to work, I tried out the voice recognition software and it wouldn't function at all, still in development it seems. This app is worth the time and easy to use. My kid would download every commercial he saw, this prevents that. Plus he can only play games I let him, some of the ones he was downloading were....just plain weird.",3

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,Shi K,The idea is great and I love that the kids can only access the apps that I've put on their dashboard. But the whole point for me was I wanted to limit their app usage and that function didn't work at all. In the reports it says I have a limit for an app set and then shows the correct actual usage and it's always over the limit. It never blocks anything even though I have all the permissions set like the app asked. I'm so disappointed. This would've been great if that function actually worked.,1

I would never allow my 5 and 7 year old Boys access to phone or tablet without locking them down, can't do this on IOS which is disgraceful of Apple. With Kidsplace I can set the apps I want my Boys to have access to and with the video app I can select the youtube videos I have screened for content I approve of. Youtube and youtube kids has a lot of completely unsuitable brainless rubbish that I do not want them having access to and even if you select their age it can bring up content I deem unsuitable. One thing I would suggest to the developers is if they can integrate youtube into the app a little better to make it easier to use while still allowing the parent full control over content + the thumbnails of youtube videos is very poor quality. I can also set a timer and set the app that it's not possible for the Boys to get out of the Kids Place app. So I am giving this 5 stars because it really deserves it.",5

The Samsung kids app refuses to allow you to add the play store for whatever reason. However, I REALLY wish that this app would allow apps downloaded and installed from the play store, to show in Kids Place. I already have parental controls installed on my kid's play store account, so I'm fine with them adding games as I have to approve every one that they download. Since Samsung phones have the Games launcher I can get around that, but that's clunky. Just allow download apps to be shown or at least have that as an option in the Parental Controls settings.",3

Edit: Nevermind, it must have been an update related thing, Kids Place just detected it wasn't the default home app anymore and warned me, then gave me an option to set it again (it wasn't in the android settings options oddly, but from within Kids Place itself it popped up with a message).",5

There's a tiny bit of a learning curve as far as settings and apps go, but that's certainly doesn't take away from it! I'm so glad I'm able to use something like this on my phone. Totally recommend if you've got a kid who likes to play with your phone and you don't want them to be able to get into your other apps",5

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Uninstalled this app because everytime I would get a notification for new features it would boot up the app and lock me out of my phone which was really annoying. Then somehow later the app received an update and I found it in my phone again and wouldn't you know it locked my phone only I hadn't used it in nearly a year and couldn't remember the unlock password. Save yourself the hassle and find a better app for child protecting your phone.,1

I brought the full version and have three suggestions regarding the UI (will revise the score if they will be taken into consideration): 1. It is better to complete disable home/back/overview buttons of the android system, because for most of the cases they are locked, and pressing these buttons causes flickers of the UI. At least abate the flickers please. 2. customize child name and profile picture. 3. When the time is out, it is better to have a nice background picture showing themes like sleepy beauty or going to bed instead of a rigid dialogue. I suggest the authors check the ""kids home"" on Samsung tablets, which does not present these two issues and have an overall smoother UI experience.",3

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"Good for long time. Still good but as always money takes root and features that used to be there move to pay only. In this case the ability to disable internet access per app on the free version went poof the last update without warning; result: pop-ups start in kids games, result: very inappropriate one coming up before I found out that only choice was to now to completely disable internet. No choice but to pay now...OK. Bad mood. Must go through my account as kids can not even access google services. So it says it will cost $5.99.... click buy and then price changes at the final screen to $12.99? OK, now I paid... oops they use a buggy method of logging that premium upgrade.... the kids accounts do not show premium...restricted so ""restore"" purchase will never work. Had to wipe all game saves etc. for each kid and remake accounts. Even then still had to try ""restore"" multiple times before it agreed I paid. And who knows future re-installs. EDIT: Shortened up & +star for reply. Will not be asking for refund; not worth more time and might as well have latest version for future instead of trading the fix of one issue with a special apk only to be outdated by next upgrade.

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Well my dad put it on me and if u think about it it is quite easy for kids to delete the app cuz every time you restart the phone it goes to the the normal page and then after like 5 minuets it goes back to kids place so if kids can get to app store and delete the app in that time then it is bacicly useless and only my dad knows the password so if he is on a trip and I need to access google I have to wait a while. It also had so many restictions but now the app is gone I don't have to deal with it any more. But other than that the app is pretty decent,3

Original post: I received the email to register for an account and when I pressed the button to confirm my email address, it took me to a page that offered other apps that work with this one. Each one I chose took me to a page with different notices and alerts like my device has a virus and to install their virus cleaner or I won a prize. This is a bad practice to lure people into downloading malware. I am extremely disappointed with this company that is supposed to help me keep my kids safe but in reality is trying to take advantage of people that wouldn't know better.

great features that used to be free are now only available in the paid

show apps when you rotate the phone or when you exit an app. Some apps have 
approval to be in the kids place but won't open and give the kids place 
lock screen. Some apps will attempt to open and then we'll just get shut 
down and the kids place app screen will appear, again, sometimes without 
the thumbnails. Then when you enter the kids place it is forever asking you 
if you want to lock the home button, no matter how many times you know you 
have already selected that in the settings of the app. Or it acts like it 
is the first time you have entered the app and tries to give you the EULA 
and gets locked on that screen. Sometimes I have to turn the phone off to 
get out of it. When you exit the app it is forever asking you how you want 
to perform the operation, with touchwiz home or touchwiz home easy, no 
matter how many times you made that selection before. I going to get a 
different one because this one has deteriorated in quality so much and has

I'm on my third phone and fourth year having this app and it does exactly what I need it to do. Which is give my toddlers a safe place on my phone to play where I don't have to worry about them dialing out or posting jibberish to FB. They can play with the apps I allow and flip back and forth on the screens like I can but only have access to the apps I want and only access the internet through apps I allow. Love kids place!

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"I love this app. I gave it three because of an issue with the timer feature. I do not like that the timer kicks my nephew out of the app he is playing in to show a thirty second countdown until the timer is finished. That is incredibly unhelpful, especially because he has special needs. I would rather there was a timer present somewhat on the screen that the child can see running down. I imagine a bar at the top of the screen running down and changing color from green to red as it runs out. There could also be a digital timer in the corner. This would allow me to see how much time is left at a glance while utilizing a visual component for my nephew to see time running out. I have suggested this before but it has not yet happened. I would give this app 5 stars if this issue were resolved.",3

Kids place for the longest time that I can remember, had the functionally for free ever since I first started using it a long time ago.  I'm very disappointed it has come to this. Wifi toggle for individual apps is important since alot of apps has ads that kids can press and it will try to exit out the app to a browser.  Of course, kids place will block it. But the app the child opened will auto open again. Imagine the child keep pressing on the same ads area again and again. Guess what will happen?  With wifi toggle off the ads won't appear for most apps and when you press on it, it doesn't do anything most of the time. And that's why I'm very disappointed.  Hopefully you developer people of kids place app can return the ""WiFi toggle for individual apps"" to be a free function for all again.",3

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,This app locked up my tablet. I can't exit out of this app at no matter what if I use my pin or there pin. So now I have to have my tablet rest or put my tablet in the shop to have it fixed. Worse app ever,1
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Excellent place to keep all of my child's favorite apps.,5

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"This app is great, the kids don't have access to anything out side of the app. You choose what they can play.",4
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,My 2 year old can use this to enjoy only the apps I enable.  Anything outside of the kids place home page is restricted and protected by password.  Kids place immediately takes her back to its homepage if she tries to close the app.  I don't have to worry about her exploring inappropriate content.  Its great!,5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,I HATE ITüò®,1

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"Finally a parental control app that doesn't cost the earth. The free version is ok, fairly decent features.

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"It's a battery hog but other than that, it works fine.",3
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,This app sucks,1
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Giving it one star because it won't stop nagging me to rate it. Backfire. Also doesn't display battery level. Annoying.,1
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"It's an amazing app, UI is easy and smooth and user friendly. Only issue I'm having though is even though I lock the home button, double tapping it will enable S-Voice (Not a crisis as I can easily disable the home button launching it). Also, the Recent button allows you to easily close the app and get back to Samsung TW Launcher. If there's a way I can lock the Recents and Back button with Home, then this app would truly be my saviour for my son's Galaxy Tab A (SM - T350) :) Thank you for this app btw!!!",5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Exactly what I need for my toddler. Easy setup and controls. Your device is safe from toddler tampering in minutes! Thank you devs!!,5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Love it! It keeps my child from accessing things he shouldn't and most importantly from buying things.,5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Hate it,1
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"Oftentimes this app won't allow access to the exit button, so I can't get out of the app even if I restart my phone. If your child clicks on an ad by accident, the whole game they're on will completely close. Right now I can't get the app in landscape mode, which just puts additional stress on my son. I'm tired of dealing with this, I don't know if there is any better option, but there have been too many problems with this one.",2
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"DO NOT INSTALL THIS, BECAUSE IT WON'T UNINSTALL PROPERLY!!!!   I installed this to try it out and it was way more complicated than I expected/needed. I then uninstalled it, but there doesn't seem to be any way to fully uninstalled, so when websites come up (usually as a link in Gmail or Facebook), I can't view the link at all without the app. So now I'm stuck with either losing functionality on my phone or having an unnecessary-overly complicated app on my phone that makes me jump through hoops every time I want to do anything on my phone!  A complete nightmare! AVOID!!!",1
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Good app to entertain the kids but keep them away from doing any harm elsewhere on the phone.,5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,It is horrible I hated it,1
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,I hated this. I was not able to deactivate when i was done with the awful service.,1
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,This would be a great app but my kids can EASILY get out of it by simply restarting the device. Other kids apps either don't let them restart without the password but if it does restart it goes straight to kids mode when it turns back on. Not this one. Had this for a couple weeks now uninstalling it.,2
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Very good app to have on any smart phone or tablet when you have young kids!!!,4

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Literally the best app that my little sister could have introduced me too when showing me how to get my almost 2 year old to only be allowed to use the apps I want her to have access too and to not be able to keep shutting and or turning off. Easy to use and is easy to personalizeandcustom to my liking. Best app!,5

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"I love this app. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that it has a delay when the home button is pushed which allows my son to see the main home screen and open apps. It doesn't let him interact further but the only way to prevent this is to set the home button to the app and when I do that, it makes it more difficult for me to use outside the app. I do often find Web pages open (presumably from ads) but I've overcome this by turning off mobile data. It also prevents anything but preloaded ads from playing. Overall I highly recommend this if you have kiddos.",4

Asking for to set up this as a default launcher always and it not remembering it is little annoying. But other than that does a very good job of making sure your kid does not get out of this.

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"It's still easy to hack out of if you have a gifted kid.  Here's 2 ways to get out of Kids Place mode without requiring the kids place password.   Please fix these loopholes!  1.  When you lightly press the power button to turn off the screen, and then lightly press it again to turn the screen back on, you can see the little ""guest user icon"" on the top right of the screen (even with notification bar lock set to on).   This happens no matter what setting I have enable in Kids Place.  2.  Same original problem.  When you lightly press the power button to turn off the screen, and then lightly press it again to turn the screen back on, you have ability to press the camera button, and from there you can exit out of the camera mode back into your ""adult"" android mode.  So basically I had to go into developer mode in android and disable the guest user mode function in order to eliminate this workaround.   But I shouldn't have to do this....  1/4/17 UPDATE:   now my son figured out he can swipe from far right to left to access another menu (it seems to bring up homepage menu - contacts, etc.).   Is there a way to disable this?",3

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"7 year old granddaughter loves it on long journeys in the car. Restricts access to the rest of the phone quite well, but she can still access things from the notification bar or the power button menu that I'd rather block (like reading an incoming text or turning the phone off) but this has improved over time. One problem though, it says ""Sorry we've encountered an error"" and tells me to press a non existent button to inform kiddoware. The problem seems to be that it can't handle the number of apps on my device (galaxy S4 KitKat) which makes it hard to add new apps, so you have to be really quick to add apps before it reads too far down the list and crashes. Pretty much impossible to add an app that begins with the letter ""Z""... Granddaughter doesn't care, so 5 stars anyway...  Very good response from Kiddoware, they are looking into my issues. In order to report an error I had to go to ""Settings"" > ""Contact Us"" and tap the ""Report Error"" button, which I wasn't aware of before they just told me.",5

This Kids Place Parental Control app filled that gap nicely.  Not only does it fully limit which apps kids have access to, it blocks in-app purchases AND access to browsing the Internet if an app tries to open another app (like a Web browser).  The only reason I give it 4 rather than 5 stars is it's sort of a cruddy UI/UX and would benefit from some professional UX and UI designers helping with the aesthetics.

Either too easy to get out, too hard, or don't allow for all apps you want to be within. This one is perfect. 15 months later, 5 stars!",5

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"To date, I still use this app (and a bunch of the associated plugins) and a few others by this developer. I've been using this app ever since it came out.   Around 2011, I was looking for a solution to turn my older phones into non-phones that my very young children could use safely and age-appropriately. Until this app came out, I resorted to rooting, flashing and trying to customize my devices. This app has been a time-saver and an excellent way to hand a device to a child with complete peace-of-mind. For instance, the addition of the feature to disable wifi for each app (you can customize which app the child can access) has been invaluable. The time-limit and scheduler works perfectly.  However, more than just the functionality of the app, the developers are outstanding. They have been very quick to respond to my numerous emails and questions. They've bent over backwards to help with my particular configuration. One time, I even got a response from someone while they were about to go on vacation!   All in all, I highly recommend this developer's suite of apps for anyone with young children.",5

Hold down the poweroff option, do not just tap it. The device will say, boot into safe mode? Select yes. Next time you boot, parental controls will not run and you can uninstall it. After uninstalling it you can go back to normal. Booting into safe mode varies from device to device. You can google to see how. Boot means to start your device. 2. This way will certainly work but will reset your device. Boot into recovery mode by turning your device off. After your device is off, Hold the volume down button first than press the power button while holding both buttons at the same time until the device starts up or volume up button first than press the power button second while holding both at the same time until the device starts up. You will get into a screen that has these options: Reboot into recovery, Reboot system now, and Fastboot. Using the volume up and down keys, select reboot into recovery. Select wipe cache partition. Next, select, wipe user data After that select reboot system now. You have an unrestricked device! I rated 2* because it was fun hacking.",2

Ask for more time and just set times where they can't access it if you have gone to bed because of time restraints.,4
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Works just like it should a few more options and it'd be best one out.	It works great on my daughters tablet. I like the time controls down to specific apps since we use it for homeschooling and don't want it to be completely locked down. Some things I'd like added or changed would be a parent mode for making all your changes in at once instead of having to put your pin every time You need to make a change. A activity log that could be uploaded or emailed to you that could be tell you how much time was spent in what catagories and/or apps.,5

But the ""lock home button"" feature overrides the home button setting for my custom launcher and lockscreen, so every time I enter Kids Place I have to re-lock the home button, and when I exit I have to re-enable the home button to work with my launcher and lock screen.  That's too much to do every time I want to allow my child to play with the device, and locking the home button is a must.  Otherwise, it's a very good app.",4

Any app with a YouTube video or link will grant them access to nasty world of internet videos. - turning off or restarting  phone leaves the app -video extension app does not work well",3

This is the same whatever the icon size. Makes it hard to know what you're picking unless you recognise it from the icon which is often a random screen grab. Otherwise great,4

Its reminders to share via Facebook or Twitter upon exit gets annoying, but completely understandable. Overall a very good app. No more rearranged apps, phone calls to old acquaintances, etc. I'd give five stars if it didn't lag so much after pressing the home key and the screen that then reminds the user how to exit the app.  **EDIT** Changed my rating to five stars because the lag I mentioned in my prior sentence can be changed in the settings just like the developer mentions in his response to my first comment.",5

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,My nephew plays with my tablet ever day n he 3 n I put on this  so if he pushes the ad at a bottom it won't go to it thxs for making a great app,5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"PROs: I have 4 Android devices and they all have this app.  You can set up Kids place with a pin code to adjust settings, add apps for them to access, and to exit the app.  It even will lock the kids in the app if it was activated and the power was reset.  It gives you a lot of options, like Block calls or turn on airplane mode.  I do not use ether of these modes on my phone.  But it helps save power on my kids tablet!  When I log out of kids place, I get my WiFi back and do whatever I want on the standard launcher (Update apps, change settings,add new apps, etc).  Before I give the tablet back to the kids, I put it into Kids Place and it locks them out of the main Android OS.  Keeps them off the internet! CONs:  I don't know if this can be fixed, because of the protection that is necessary with Kids Place.  But if you open an app like Angry Birds, and there is an internet advertisement.  The app will just close since the app cannot hit the internet and may need something that I have not given Kids Place access to.  Then if the app is reopened, then it starts where it last left off.  Which is the advertisement, then closes the app again. The only work around is to exit Kids Place.",5

Also he knows how to shut off the screen and turn it back on then he quickly presses anything on the screen before the app can reload, then the app won't load at all.

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Kids Place is a really simple and effective app that enables you as a parent to lock your down your Nexus tablet to the Kids place screen. The app doesn't lock you in to its own games and you can simply choose any apps you want to make available for your child. Another really great part is the additional Kids Place Video player that allows you control access to only the videos that you want to child to see from You Tube. You can also easily revert to your normal Nexus home screen via a 4 digit pin. Cant rate Kids Place highly enough after trying and removing several other parental control applications. Its also appears to be free so far!!,5

It would work better if every time I turned it on, it would reset to the chosen amount of time.",4

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"First Review I've ever done on Android market app, but I've been using all apps for over 2 years.  I'm so impressed with this app and how it modifies your tablet to be set to use only for children.  If an ad appears in a program, this app will prevent your youngster from navigating away from that app to the add, which makes this feature beneficial if you need time to do something around the house and you want your child to focus on an educational app and not need you to come over to assist them in order to get back to the app they were originally working from.  Usually I only use ad-free apps in order to prevent this from occurring.  Another great option is the ability to pre-select apps to display on the screen that you want your child to use, without your adult apps being mixed in.  I can't believe I didn't pay for this apps.  I've tried many child lock apps and launchers designed for children, but nothing comes anywhere close to how great this App is.   5 Stars.  If this software company made their own tablet, I would buy it.  Thank You Kiddoware!",5

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"Does what it says, is easy for a 18 month-old (and up) to use and is really helpful in occasions when you need the child to sit still for some minutes. However, Google Play store and Facebook are not entirely blocked - once the child lands there via a link in the app, they can navigate around rather freely. Edited: there was an exit bug that was fixed upon contacting the support - thanks!",4

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,This works but why cant we set it so that all home buttons are disabled?  My son loves to press the home key because he knows it closes the program.  He is only 2 but hes smart as a whip.   you could make it so you have to press the 4 corners of the screen in a sequence to get into another app.  I would like to lock the phones bottom buttons since they are touch sensitive and he always touches them accidentally.  It would be great to lock the phone so that you cannot exit the started application unless the parent touches the screen in a certain sequence or touches the home buttons in a sequence.  maybe you could temporarily take over the power button/volume buttons as a control to unlock?,3

Example:  BSPlayer will exit out to zoodles dashboard after a single movie is played.  These sorts of issues don't seem to happen in Kids Place Parental Control.   The Kids Place interface is also a bit simpler.  The one issue I do have (and maybe it's not an issue, but a behavior), some apps don't really exit when you exit them, so when you re-open them you are exactly at the same point in the program as when you exited.  For my Trainz sim, this is quite useful but for other apps not as much.  Thanks for this app, definitely recommend it for Google Nexus 7.",5

Resetting it up, over and over again.  Contact with developer...all my kid had to do was turn off the tablet and then turn it on again and he was out of Kids Place - even though I repeatedly set the option to launch the app on device restart.  From there he just deleted the app.   After many trials and tribulations must move on to something else.",1
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"This app is the best but unfortunately i have to mention two important glitches:  1. Power button isn't disabled so your kid can turn the device off, turn it on again and get unlimited access. 2. If you use a launcher besides stock the ""lock home button"" function gets confused and when you exit the app, you'll be asked to determine which launcher you want to use.

I installed it on my daughters phone so that I could lock down YouTube etc but still let her use the phone as originally intended. It should feel more like the phone interface with sliding screens changeable wallpaper and resizable high quality icons, etc.  It feels simple and aimed at very young kids but my 11yr old daughter hates it. I installed Go Launcher and enabled it through the app.  The app still works and blocks all but the allowed apps and only permits the Kids Place to be used as the default Home screen. The Go Launcher needs to be launched from within the app. One big problem, the timer completely locks the phone. Can't even use the phone as a phone.  Change the UI, make the timer customisable, ie let the administrator decide when the phone can/can't be used, blocked during the school day for instance, and this will become a great app. then it will be worthy of 5 stars.",4

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"I recently converted two old phones for exclusive use of my 6 and 3 year old boys. With Kids Place in effect, they're locked down from accessing anything other than what I chose to give them access to. Since I don't allow them access to a web browser or the play store, they can't access any new apps or anything on the internet (that uses a browser.)  I did have one problem. The apps I selected weren't showing up after I rebooted the phone. This was happening for any app installed on the SD card. I emailed the developers and they provided a fix within a couple days.   My only lasting complaint is that I wish this was a $0.99 or $1.99 app with a lite version so I could reward them for their good work.  The phones we're using are a Nexus 1 and an EVO 4G. The Nexus is relatively stock, but the EVO has Cyanogenmod 7 on it so my 6 year old can use Google Talk to video chat with his grandparents (and me at work!)  Since we've done this, we find that the 6 year old is spending more time reading and writing (he loves to send IMs to us) and he's exploring with Maps, Earth, Astronomy apps, etc. The three year old is having fun, even when he's just pretending he's smarter than a 6y.o.",5

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Awesome awesome app : ),5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"Does what his says.  My kids can't accidentally dial, text, etc.",5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Now if only it could disable the task bar on my galaxy tab :),5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"My 3 yr old like to play with my Droid, and the fire so I installed this app on both things now I don't have to worry about him buying things or playing adult games. Awesome!!!!",5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,It is a great program and does it's job. I am happy with it and it doesn't crash enough for me to get too frustrated. I wish they had this program for Apple,4
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"This app has worked great. My 2 1/2 yr old always wants to play with my phone, now i can let him. He has even clicked on the advertisements and it always sends him right back. 5 stars",5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,I no longer have to worry about my ten year old accessing files and apparently on my Tab without my permission!,5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,It puts all of my children's games in one place and keeps my toddler from getting into things he shouldn't. Thank you!,5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Excellent! Means i can let my little girl have my phone without worrying :),5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"The entire phone stays locked, its great....",5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"My nieces, nephews, and godchildren always bum rush me when we're together in a unified chorus begging to play with my phone. Up until this point for obvious reasons I've been reticent about turning it over to them, but today I stumbled across this app, and it is the perfect solution to my problem. Now I can allow them to play the games that they love on the phone without worrying that they're going to access something that may become problematic. Kids Place is very user friendly.  I had everything set up, running, and tested in way under three minutes.  Many thanks to the devs for coming up with this one.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"Best app ever! Not only does it do it's job, it locks my bf out too.",5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Keeps my 3 yr old from rearranging my phone!! Thank you Kids Place!,5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Great ap works gud on my lg 3d gud work,5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Great app and so convienient. The shortcuts could be worked in a bit but it does the job nicely.,4
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Decent enough. Bit buggy but good for a free app. Occasionally crashes device on Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman.	Child lock works really well and on the whole app is more user friendly than others in its class. A good choice if you can live with the occasional crash.,4
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,What a great program. Restricted apps to only the stuff you want your kids to get at. Didn't let them download or buy anything so you don't get that suprise 400 dollar phone bill. And it even has a timer in case you forget how long Jr is allowed to use the phone for. Highly recommended!,5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,I keep all my kids games locked in KidsPlace. I never have to worry about them messing with settings on my device. Market lock and timer are great features.  On my rooted device I can block ads too. KidsPlace needs a rooted version with an ad blocker built in as well as a block for email sharing found in many games. I'd buy it in a heartbeat. THIS APP IS INDISPENSABLE IF YOU HAVE KIDS ON YOUR DEVICE.,5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Reall good get it now,5
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"keeps my toddler from making phone calls and buying apps! very good app, if you have a small child that plays with your Android device, you need this app!",5

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,My only complaint is that my kids have found ways out of it if they have a quick enough finger. But overall very pleased with this app!,4
com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,Keeps my two year old occupied when i need him occupied,5

com.kiddoware.kidsplace,A Google user,"Really great app - allows access to any apps you want to allow access to, while preventing the child getting out of the lock.  Also engages airplane mode if selected which means the child cannot purchase apps, access ads (or even view ads!) and make phone calls.  Fantastic!",5

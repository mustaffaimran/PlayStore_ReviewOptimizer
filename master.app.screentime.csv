The latest update somehow broke the software; the latest revision forces you to pay to be able to use the ""limit screentime function."" I paid it as it's not much money, $2.95 or something i believe.. but even after paying to get rid of the annoying ads and have the ""limit screen time function,"" somehow it doesn't work..

master.app.screentime,Ace 21.04,Great experience I've had. Best screen time app ever and that too for free.üëçüèªüëåüèª,5
master.app.screentime,Ahmed Omar,The app shows you the daily usage of the phone and the apps that you spend the most which you can set a limit on.,5
master.app.screentime,Ben Thurau,Gucci!,5
master.app.screentime,Max Holt,this app was great in theory but when I set limits for my social media apps it waits tell I'm like ten minutes past my limit to tell me I hit my Facebook limit. Not helpful for my end goal to break phone addiction when it doesn't follow the time duration limit I set for each of my social-media apps. please fix this. also when I set a Facebook usage limit to only a half hour and I get to my half hour limit the app data will say I was on Facebook for three hours which isn't possible. fix pls,3
master.app.screentime,Break the Image,Great for understanding your use of apps. Being able to put caps on apps you use to much to limit your time. The app gives you more power of addictive apps. Helping you to build better habits. In lockdown instead of instergram for hours.,4
master.app.screentime,G drun,Was okay but it also installed an ad popup software on my phone so I would get ads popping up suddenly on my home screen. The issue stopped when I stopped this app. I'm deleting it now.,2
master.app.screentime,Jaspreet Kaur,Provides whatever I wanted. Gives a pop up notification when time limit set by you for a particular app is over. Helps me track my mobile usage time and activity and thus helps me reduce it.,5

master.app.screentime,Steve Roth,"This is based on the apple phone screen time control. However this one DOES NOT WORK. My kids found a work around to this blocking app.. they will close the tab where the screen time block appears, which is actually layered over the original blocked tab and click on the tab underneath, they do that 3 times and the blocked app tab page stops appearing and the app that is supposed to be blocked is now fully accessible. USELESS TO CONTROL WHAT APPS KIDS MAY USE OR HOW LONG.",1

master.app.screentime,A Google user,It's really useful I use it for my mental health,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,I found this app very useful but I would have liked there to be a time limit of when you you go on your phone rather than how long for. For example: no phone usage between 10pm and 6am.,4
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Would be better if could see past days usage in terms of different apps used,4

I love how if you scroll to your notification it tell u how long you have been on your phone on that current day. There is barley a single app and the only adds there are are just the ones at the bottom of the screen that you don't even need to watch. 10/10 this app is and it's better than all the other apps like this on this app store.",5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"This application makes me control my time more appropriate, sometimes also warns me how often I have use my phone. When I need to study or focus on something, the time limit function helps me stay away from my phone. This is really useful, and it is worth to buy the VIP version.",5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,This app has allowed me to manage the amount of time I spend on my phone. I 10/10 recommend this to anyone who spends WAY too much time on their phone. It's really easy to use. I especially like that it provides the amount of hours you spend on your phone each day. Thank you to whoever made this app :),5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Can be more specific,4
master.app.screentime,A Google user,It was a good app before random full screen ads started to popup. I had to spend time to understand which app they were coming from. Update: switched to AppBlock which works better and more functional.,1
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"After I bought the version without ad's the functionality became less than before. You are supposed to see more detailed historical statistics about your use, but the including bar graphs don't match the numbers at all and sometimes the daily chart bugs out and you can only switch between the same day (so if it's Monday today, only to previous Mondays, but not to previous Tuesdays-Sundays ). The non-paid version honestly worked better and more elegantly.",1

Gives up to last 7 days statistic (I use the free version), which is good enough for me. You can set limit based on certain app or categories, if let say you want to minimize all ""social media"" or ""entertainment"".",5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,This app is really great. Thanks for you time and energy that you put in it,5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Adds started popping out of the blue, worst way to loose your users.",1
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"In my opinion this app is great because it allows android users to track your screen time and set limits! I am only giving it 4 stars because of my own personal preference. I like to fall asleep to informative lives such as Steve Backshall or podcasts/music on spotify, which highly affects my screen time even though im not actively using my phone. Other than this inaccuracy for me specifically, it is great. Is there a way for me to turn screen time off for certain periods of time?",4
master.app.screentime,A Google user,It does what it offers . But it is not very strict . its very easy to ignore the limit.yes it might be impractical for some people.but i would appreciate it if it was a little strict.,5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Good,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Easy and simple. Meets all expectations and luckily an app that doesn't swarm you with ads. One small issue is that the screen time bar in the notifications is cut right on the bottom half of the text, and although readable, it's a bit of an eyesore, especially because i like this feature and I want to use it.

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Useful. Shows you just how much screen time you really do spend!,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Doesnt work? I set my limit to one hour on instagram and I've accidentally spent an average of 3 hours per day on it. Not the only app it didnt work for either. Whoever coded this might wanna consider a profession at dominos or something more their speed,1

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Good app. But I will suggest start MONTHLY TRACKING also. Why LIMIT your self to only LAST SEVEN days?,3
master.app.screentime,A Google user,So you need to make money I understand but you should have said it in update because now there is an ad showing below most used app. I don't mind watching ads but you need to put it in that there is an ad pop up.

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Useful app,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,One defect is that anybody has access to Google Play could uninstall this app to eliminate the screen time. This is not desired as children could uninstall this app and defeated the whole intention of screen time.,4

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"its a very useful and nice app. i have a suggestion for you. i limited my apps by passcode and i told my mom to insert the passcode, because i didn't want to give myself the extra chance of use the app in a day. but in some cases, i needed an app a little more. for example i was in the middle of a important chat and i didn,t have my passcode. so you can add an option that give you 5 or 10 min more in just one app in a day once, not more.",5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"The app worked for the first few months, so I had my husband set a passcode that I did not know so that I could limit my screen time. The app promptly stopped working after this, and no matter how many times we reset the limits and passcodes, it did not fix it. This is really a shame because this app was so simple and easy to use, as opposed to parental control apps which affect phone functions and apps that you don't want them to interfere with. Really a shame.",1
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Looks like it would be a great tool, but even after I fixed all the settings, the time up pop up box would not pop up. Only after I clicked on the app box and exited did it tell me, ""times up"". That's not gonna help that way.",2
master.app.screentime,A Google user,I was genuinely trying to help my phone addiction where I would spend nearly 9 hours a day on my phone. The app started out great and then stopped working. Notifications that I reached my limit stopped working. I would be on an app for 3 hours not realizing my one hour limit had already past. Very frustrating that the apps only glitch is that it's sole purpose doesn't work.,1

Sometimes the notifications don't ring out but that is a tiny problem. I would actually pay for this lol, shame though cus I wouldn't have tried it if it was a paid app. Keep it free please.",5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"The app is great if you only want to limit the amount of hours you are on your phone, but there is no way to set a downtime like you can on iphones. I want an app that will not let me on social media at designated times when I should be working or sleeping.",2

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Simple and easy to use but the touch sensitivity on the graph is super inaccurate,4
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"I love the idea and the functionality, but I just wish that you could change how long to wait until a reminder. They only allow you 15 minutes or an hour, but I feel like it would work a lot better for me if I could set my own reminder in a shorter amount of time.",3
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Does not launch when system boots do the app needs to be manually launched.,3

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"I'm not sure if this is the app or my phone but it does not always track my time, it will just go away. Other times I can see that it is tracking everything but it doesn't tell me that I've reached my limit until I've went 30 minutes to an hour over. The concept is great and when it works it's exactly what I want",3
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Good,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Useful,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"It's exactly what it says it is. Neat and organized interface; setting app limits was a breeze. Overall, I am loving this app, it's definitely interesting and helpful to see what apps you spend the most time on and when you're on your phone the most.",5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Seems like a nice app. Simple and easy to understand, but the limit setting does not work. I can see my usage per app, but if I set a limit for an app and then use the app for longer than the limit nothing happens. Maybe I misunderstood the point of the limit, but I was assuming it would prevent further app usage.",1
master.app.screentime,A Google user,As soon as I downloaded it instantly tells you how much time you spend on each app. Really cool app,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Very helpful!,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Love it! Easy to use. Shows you where your spending your phone time. Good eye opener. Gives both daily and 7 day time. Also provides limits.

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Great app of you want it just to tell you how much time you spend on your phone. But I can't get it to tell me when my limit is up on certain apps and app categories. I don't know if there's a setting that I missed or what...,3
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"It said I was on my phone for 21 HOURS! I was only on it for ten hours this week! It has horrible accuracy and NEEDS to be fixed.

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Good,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Excellent tool. Specify a time limit for specific apps, get a ""times up"" screen when your usage reaches that time, but you can also decide to continue for 15 minute increments in order to finish what you were doing. The app also keeps track of total phone usage in a daily or weekly graph seperating your activity into catagories. Best part is that I haven't been asked to buy or pay for anything. I'm very happy with it, I'll be keeping this app on my phone for a long time.",5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Good for keeping an eye on your time.,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Useful for being mindful about how much time you spend on less productive apps. You can set a limit for specific apps and it will tell you when your time is up. It's possible to ignore the limit (at least without a password, I think you can set one if you want to use this as a parent or have an accountability partner) but I find that even if I ignore it once I usually leave the app soon after.",5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,I would really recommend giving the app YourHour a try. It seems to have a lot more features than this one and it also has the option of enabling or disabling all of its features for a particular app. The Screen Time app is not as thorough when it comes to phone usage tracking.,1

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Insightful feedback.,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"I would've given this app 5 stars, but it doesn't start limiting your screen time until you've open the app after you're device turns back on. But props to the app for being free and being the ""Well-being"" feature for Android devices that don't have that feature built it.",3
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"This is very useful, easy to use and clear in what it shows you about your usage.",5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Damn, I was really shocked at some of my application usage's duration. And I could successfully limit myself significantly.",5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Really good app for checking your screen time as it divides your app usage into certain categories which give's great insight! It also doesn't count the usage of your phone if you have the apps open but your phone turned off which is a REALLLY Good Feature as other apps do that and it is very annoying.,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Great Should add average daily use,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Its great!,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,This is a great app for seeing how much you've been on your phone or tablet! It also allows you to set limits on apps you want to cut down on using. The app interface could look a little less like an iPhone though.,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Great,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,This app is great. After two days I'm shocked at how much I use my phone and motivated to change course. It's helpful to be able to visualise my screen time. I just WISH I could name my own categories.,3

At first, I was really determined to not get addicted to my phone and video games. But as the weeks passed by, I realized I HAD gottened addicted to my phone, so I searched up "" how long have I been on my phone"" in the google app store and found this. It's AWESOME!",5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Great idea, with semi-customizable execution. It categorizes apps for you, and doesn't let you make a custom limit yourself. 4‚òÜ if the developer already had all the categories right, but they haven't. But I like detail the best.

It's very accurate and I can easily access it with just a swipe But I think you should add an option to not track( or not to show it on the total screen time) some apps because someone may use app like ""Clock"" to track their work and they don't look at the screen most of the time.This may be unnecessary but I think the app, notification would looks nicer with darkmode :)",5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"This is the best app I've found for limiting screen use if you're trying to cut back. It's pretty easy to turn off the limits if you know the pin, but it's a good reminder to turn it off. You can put a limit on just one app or a group. The only suggestions I have are maybe show how much time is remaining in the limits, add an optional time penalty to be able to disable the limit, and be able to set an alarm instead of a timer",5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"This app has truly helped me grasp how much of my time is wasted each day on senseless things, and is helping make better decisions with what I do with my time. I love that you can customize which apps to track and which ones to leave alone, as well as the fact that it let's you set your own limits for what you deem as healthy. And I must admit, I love that it allows you to snooze the timer when you just need a few more minutes of mindless browsing... It's a great app - I highly recommend it!",5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Just great üòä no ads, super cool iphone features",5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,perfect,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Good,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,I would have given 5 bc for a few days it was perfect. But then it just stopped working. No limits popping up and not even recording screen time. My 4yo was on for 45 min when I came to check it (his limit is 30min) and it said 0min. I checked all of the settings and everything is in order so idk why it isn't working. Update: Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. I hoped it would just be a temp. glitch but it's been a week. Deleted üòû,1
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Very useful app,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,It would be better if there is a black theme,4
master.app.screentime,A Google user,fantastic app everüòçüòç,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Never actually sticks to limits. This app does an OK job of monitoring what apps are being used and for how long. But it never sticks to the limits that are set, and always lets the user go over before warning that the limit has been met, usually by as much as half. (Example, limit was set for an hour, but didn't disable screen time usage until an hour and a half.) Also, it's really annoying how the limit needs to be overridden at least twice to just get the app being used to close.",2
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Easy to use and quite informative. No ads either.,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Ok üëåüëåüëå,4

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Very best at doing its job. I commend this!,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Ive noticed that it only shows your time limit on an app if you have the screen time app open at the same time.

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Love it!,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Great app to track how long I have used my phone. It definitely helps me a lot because I see it every time I pull down the notification bar. It also has a time limit that you can apply to your apps and that helps a ton. This is a great one. 5 stars.,5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,It's really great,5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Need to be polished more to be productive app. Many features need to be included. Like screen time widget floating on every app that I use so that u can see how much time I have given this without going to main app to see all all,3

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Very clear and understandable interface. I like that the tracker also shows in the notification bar. And there are no ads which adds to my overall positive experience. If I could improve it, I would include the option to add daily & weekly screen time goals and small rewards when they are met e.g. An alert saying ""well done!""",4
master.app.screentime,A Google user,How should i remove the limit and make the app free from the limit......because after uninstallling the limit of the app is same which i had set before..,1
master.app.screentime,A Google user,The best app! No bugs no ads perfect for use!,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,I have tried a lot of free apps for controlling my screen time on social media and by far this is the best that was available. There are better apps than this but ofcourse they are paid.,5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Nice app to track the usage,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,This app is good! It actually tallies the screen time use. One could also customize the time limit and the apps to be limited.,5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Very nice app, straightforward to use. I wish it showed unlock count, as it's an important metric.",5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Awesome usage tracker. I like that it only tracks usage that has the screen on.

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Great app! Only thing I ask is, allow us to customize category names and give usage vs time graphs for the individual apps as well. Graphics could be improved a bit too.",4

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Very good app and we know the time we using the mobile,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,The app is really helpful at making me realise the amount of time I was spending on my phone. Only wish that the screen time notification could also show usage by individual app or the option to create your own categories so that i dont need to open the app to find out time spent on a specific app.,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Very useful app and gives good insight,5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Clean, easy to use and does exactly what you would hope and expect. Initially it horrified me by explicitly displaying my excessive screen-time usage.

master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Make it harder to ignore limit. It's so easy for me to ignore limit that I click it everytime and the next thing I knew, I already spent an hour. Perhaps shortening the ignore limit to 5 or 10 mins, with just a limited number of times to limit and, and user has to go to the app to ignore limit.",4

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Nice,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,The app needs a zen mode like feature with exclusive phone access allowed,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Perfect & no ads! Worth it 100%,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"It's got a really simple user interface so it's easy to use. I like that it breaks down my screen time by category and app, cause i dont think of reading ebooks as ""as bad"" as spending 2 hours watching silly clickbait YouTube videos. Since installing I've cut down my screen time by about half what I used to get. It's also just generally interesting to know what apps I use the most. Also If you want to just listen to an app with the screen off, it does not count as screen time, which makes sense!",5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Very good app to control apps.,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,It's honestly pretty useful I just think it should lock you out of apps once you reach the limit instead giving you the option to ignore it,4

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Love the clarity of the app and segregation into different categories. Its helping me control screen time,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,It's a good app but when you turn on the screen time it makes ur phone super laggy and very slow. And it's incorrect about how long I've been on my phone.,3

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Useless. I limit Youtube for 1 hour and yet my daughter still viewing after 4 hours. Waste of time.,1
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Amazing. with just this accountability app i have cut my screen time down from over 6h per day to under 2.5h per day. i have become so much more productive. ive cleaned my entire room and done more spontaneous chores. im even reading at bedtime and in the morning again. im hoping to eventually get it under one hour per day,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Very useful app It keeps me under controll of screen times.,5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Good,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,App is great but it's so easy to remove the limit for a day also there should be an option for emergency use for 5 minutes only not to remove the limit completely,4
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Free, easy and good! Thanks!!",5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"Simple and straightforward. From what I've seen of the other platform, it seems similar to what you'd find on an iPhone, which is a good thing. Nice to have a good app to be aware of stuff like this, as just knowing if you're using your device too much might be a drive to put it down every now and then. Plus, completely free with no ads? Yes please!",5

master.app.screentime,A Google user,Great so far!,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,Screen Time is a valuable tool!

My only request would be that when a time limit is reached for a certain app that there is an option that 'Screen Time' can force close the app - it's much to easy to hit the 'Ignore for 15 mins' option!,5
master.app.screentime,A Google user,"This is a great concept, but it needs to be configurable to allow the user to exclude apps that shouldn't count as screen time. I have a clock/alarm app that runs as a screen saver while I sleep or when the phone is charging at my desk while I work. The data from this single app swamps all the useful data that is truly screen time and obscures the data I'm interested in.

Crucially, it let's me set time limits for specific apps or app categories. The feature that would make it 5 stars is that I wish I could set the ""reset time"" to, say, 3am instead of midnight, since I'm often up past midnight (and I want to use the app to not let me use social apps before bed!!).",4

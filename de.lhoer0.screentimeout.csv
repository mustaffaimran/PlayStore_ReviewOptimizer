de.lhoer0.screentimeout,Tam L,"Works, unlike other apps that still blackout to the Always On lock display. I use auto-click apps for grinding games and every attempt I made, to include Developer Mode always on option, even during Charge, still allows screen to darken to the Always On lock screen that blocks the full touchscreen. I edited a time for 1 hour, and it actually stayed On for more than the standard 10 min.",5

de.lhoer0.screentimeout,Ray H.,"Having just discovered that an option to adjust or disable screen timeout was available has delighted me totally. I often listen to Internet radio on my mobile and after the highest time of 10 minutes arrived, immediately radio shuts off then a reset was required to activate again. Very irritating indeed.

de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"After using an iPod touch for years and being able to make the screen timeout ""Never"", I was surprised that wasn't an option on my Galaxy SIII. I like being able to turn that off on a road trip when I'm listening to an audiobook and need immediate pause capabilities without having to unlock the screen first. This is a GREAT app, giving not only the ability to disable the time out, but also has MANY more time limit options and ability to customize. I think my favorite part is the widget that's right there and easy to turn on and off. UPDATE: Does not work with my new(er) phone. Not sure if it's the phone (LG V20) or with the OS (8.0).",2

de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,I've been using this widget for about a year and I like it. However it would be perfect if it had an option for a 10 second timeout.

de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,This app is great! Good for leaving light on the screen if you don't like complete darkness but don't want to leave a lamp on for too long.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Very good,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Perfect.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,there is no option in my mobipe,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Not working at my alcatel..,2
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,no widget.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,When I updated my phone it lost the option of screen timeout. 15sec. was the only option. This app saved me a lot of frustration.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"I was having problems with my note 4 changing my timeout but this has solved the problem, thanks",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,does what it is supposed to do love it,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Easy to use, really useful if you plan to use screen mirroring for a prolonged period of time.",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,IT WAS 100% Works...!,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Timeout not included in that...!! Tried this app. Really awesome,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Good app.  Thanks,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Does what it says it does.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Perfect app,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Perfect for you Pokemon Go players. Fed up of the 10mins standard timeout so you have to keep checking?  No more! This will kill that and let you hatch eggs as long as your battery allows!,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Simple and awesome!,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Good one,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,It's useful and also a good appp and the most important thing is that u can adjust display timeout as per ur wish,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Does not work,1
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Was searching for a good app to manually set the screen out time....nice to have this app at hand..thanks..keep it up by adding more options like -brightness control.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,So far this works :),5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"I suggest the simpler concept of another similar app: ""No Screen Off"" which won't bring its user into confusion.",1
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,No RAM uses for app and widget. Very ez to change screen timeout by just one click. People who rate 1 star are people who have no basic tech knowledge. I have never get spam email from this app.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,So after having my phone for like 2 years i finally decided to change the time out setting. Big mistake! It won't time out. I tried so many things. One suggestion was take the battery out for fifteen minutes then put it back in. This lasts for a few days then back to manually turning it off. Did anyone else have this happen to them? So far so good with this app.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Widget toggles to permanent-on setting, but does not toggle back to timed shutoff mode.",1
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"I used this app for many years, but the widget no longer does anything. It's too bad because it's a nice looking widget, which is hard to find.",3
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Wanted 20 min and I just edited 15 and there you go.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Works well,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,My Galaxy Tab 4 can go off in 1 minute instead of 5 seconds!,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,The one I am looking for. thanks to the developer!,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Small installation size. No special permissions required. Easy to use. Custom time out values can be added. Perfectness in simplicity!!,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,This app is very good,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Best screen time out app,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Thx!,4
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Works as advertised,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Very good,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Works perfectly well on my HTC M8,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"No more having to long press on System Settings, scroll down to display, then choose the timeout shorter or longer, every time...  There are so many times that I either choose a shorter time to save power or a longer time when I want to be able to view a photo without the screen turning off so soon.. all the time.  This makes it so much easier so..  Thanks so much !!!!!",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,They did provided what we Need A Longer Screen Timer . This app can Make your Screen turn ON for as far as you want it to .,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,I like to be in control of how long to set my screen.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Didn't work past 10 minutes,2
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,No matter what I choice to set it continues to stay where it was prior to the promising name of an app which hasn't helped,1
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Useless, no effect than the display time set by the system setting which is one minutes max even you selected 30 minuets by the app.",1
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Awesome,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Does a simple task very well. Good for farming in some games,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,It would be much awesome if it uses a widget,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,.,1
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Note 4 Android 5.0.1. Just doesn't work. Will be happy to try again and revisit rating if ever fixed.,1
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,didn't work.my system time out is nt wrking.thought it would work,1
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Perfect app,3
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Simple and easy to use.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Very nice app,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,I love this app which help reduce the display time to help save the battery,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Sorry to say this.... But I don't know why it is not working in my mobile lenovo vibe x2.. Please suggest me good app to switch off the screen after few seconds.,1
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Spammed my phone and email with useless messages about crap I don't care about and I hate that.,1
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,5 stars because it deserves 5 stars,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Pretty good :),5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Is it possible to put the counting remaining time on the 3x1 widget?,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,We can set our sleep time according to your required time and as some ROMS won't give settings for setting your own sleep time this app will be really help full,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Just what I needed. It's the only app I've found that is able to do this very simple thing. Now don't have to press a hundred things to change the screen timout.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Does the job,4
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,very simple but practical,4
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"This app, solved my screen timeout problem. Hoooray! :D",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Nice Nice Nice,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Awesome app,4

de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Simple and easy to use.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Excellent,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Perfect!!!  Need I say more?,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"For an app this small and limited I don't want ads. Also, the widget didn't display properly on my g3. There's a ad free app so I'll stick with that.",3
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Download Now!,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,even after rebooting phone with it set to disable timeout  screen backlight still turned off after 5 seconds  is there no ap that actually works for the android h9503,1
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,A 1x1 widget and a shortcut to timeout control does it all without hogging up space on my home screen,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Especially love the edit feature allowing the user to set customized times right down to the second. Great work,  Thanks.",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Simple but works :)),5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,It always works for me! You have to try it out!,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,there was no way to get android to invoke a screen saver like state on this little tv stick of mine.  but this solves that.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Excellent app, have been using it for over 6 months, no problem yet...",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Exeatly i want,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,the sad story i just found it,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Works well with Samsung Galaxy S4,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Exactly what I was looking for.  Uncomplicated and very easy to use.  Sometimes you just need an app to tweak one feature and not be encumbered with tons of customization.  This one fits the bill.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Really effective app. Just what I needed. If the app started automatically with the previous settings enabled after a restart, it would have got 5 stars.",4
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Waste :@,1
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,:) #1,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Works awesome!😆,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"I just began using this app, but it seems to work very well...",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Just what I wanted. Tired of going through the settings menus to switch from short timeout to long, and irritated that the phone had no ""permanently on"" option. Now a touch on a simple 1x1 widget toggles from permanently off to any fixed period.",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,1000% working,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,One of the best way to control display & increase the battery life,3
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,I put it to 5s and nothing happens it automatically switches me to 30 seconds which is pointless because I already have that on my phone.,1
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,5 stars utility. Just wish for different icon choices or at least black/white theme to suit the wallpaper.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Didn't want my map app to turn off the screen , now I can easily switch between 1 min. and 1 hour. Works good.",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"I'm a fan of simple and intuitive apps that get the job done.  This app does.  Would love to see indicator for chosen setting in status bar (indicator only shows when set to ""disable"").  Still, worthy of 5 stars.",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"A very nice app for the size,works like a treat! :)",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Jos!,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Bug report: the 1x1 widget gives an error if the screen timeout has already been disabled at time of widget installation ;),5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"No problems.  Fast and easy.  Been using it for almost 4 months.  My old phone had a similar app built in, which I loved.  Since my new phone had nothing like it, I'm extremely glad I found this app. It makes it so simple to switch between timeout settings, which I do quite often, depending on what task I'm doing.",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Great App Just So Simple And The Custom Timeout Setting Is Pretty Much All I Wanted,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Just what I needed, a no fuss timeout ,perfect, 5 stars well deserved .",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,It's just what I need..!,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,The screen continued to turn off even when I uninstalled it. I had to install it again and disable it,2
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Very simple, and easy. I also love the customization. 5 stars!",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,The notification icon will be cleaned if I swipe it. I hope the notification icon was nailed on the bar.,4
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Nearly gave this a bad review...  Update wouldn't work properly until reboot.. Now it works brilliantly!,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,I can set the screen timeout much more easily with this app! Highly recommemd!,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Does exactly what I needed it to do...disabled the timeout.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Nah, screen timeout is best. Best. Best. Best.",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Simply the best among the rest..recommended!!!,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Solid app.,4
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Quick, simple, works!",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"this app can even set the timeout in seconds.. thx thx thx... i've tried n it really works,,,",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"On my android 4.2 system, this app will not shut my screen off in under 8 seconds no matter what value I set it at.",3
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Just what I've been looking for. I don't know why Google did away with ""disable screen timeout"". And being able to set custom timeouts and not having the app running in the background makes it that much more great.",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,I am using  this application  since  many days it makes  easy toggle  of screen time out  i can't imagine to use my smart phone without it. I give it 5 stars.	Excellent  app,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Awsome,good,very best and nice app.",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Good,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Does the job and love the widget.,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Best,5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"Simple application to set your timeout, even disable it, which is what I was looking for.",5
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,"I think that this is a simple, and very useful little function. As everything, I think it would be better if more tweaks were added, and I have a few suggestions: 1. App- very simple (good), but can be made more appealing. 2. Widget- can't actually use it. Just says if screen timeout is disabled or not. Would be nice if the time that the screen is to be on for were displayed. (5m, etc.) Perhaps you could make a small box of options pop up? Or change wit every click. (would need fewer options- customizable?)",4
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Notification don't; time out turns off by itself. S3,1
de.lhoer0.screentimeout,A Google user,Works great for me did have screen timeout didn't work for me,5

de.markusfisch.android.screentime,Varun Kamath,"Is an awesome app for checking your screen time. The only feature that I would recommend in an update is to add App Limits(block usage of app after some set screen time) and usage of all apps, not just one cumulative screen time figure.",5

de.markusfisch.android.screentime,Lars Maxfield,"Does exactly what I need in the most minimalist way possible: shows my daily cumulative screen time directly in the notification bar with no added title or text. The app itself is one page showing the onâ€“off times in a clever radial barchart with a slidable dot to set the time of ""day change"" â€” i.e., the time of day when the screen time resets. That setting was the only feature which was not immediately intuitive to me; perhaps an initial hint bubble could have helped, but that's being picky.",5

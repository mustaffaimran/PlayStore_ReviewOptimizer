Also be nice to be able to set an overall time limit. ""Pause"" works but then ""unpause"" doesn't. Faff to allow extra time outside of the schedules then, not surprisingly, it sticks.

My kids ask for permission to use apps which I then grant for a limited time, but the app still won't let them into the app so I have to physically go to the app and add access which lags and is not always immediate. Then to top it off, when I set a limit for use of the app, the time goes over the timer and still grants them access, so I then have to go back into the app to restrict access again. I really wanted something automated because I tend to forget so if I forget then I need a backup. Another problem I have is there is no option (that I can find) to block access to tools/settings so my kids can go into the settings and turn the app off. Yes, it alerts me, but in the meantime they are living it up while the app is removed. It also would let me get pretty far into some apps before blocking access, for example play store.

Very easy to use and intuitive and has a lot of control over app types and web use and content. There's also live  support. The app gives an important option of limiting daily use of every app. One very important feature is missing. Such an app should include the option to allow or not allow screen time at specific time frames within the overall allowed daily time. For example, not to allow phone use and /or internet time during school hours. Additionally, it would have been very useful to be able to set daily time limits to Internet use not just by the pause button. Such features are highly important mainly because screen time recommendations are of no more than 2 hours a day for adolescents and less for younger kids. Another missing function is blocking location disabling. Another major issue is that the app should better block harmful content. Because of that I'm giving right now 4 stars.

It starts working again when I open the app again but sometimes that also fails to work. I guess it's some kind of bug. I am using redmi note 4 and  lenovo tab 7.

Remote control of device would be good too (using team viewer atm) Hide apps from app drawer or a Home screen replacement launcher or kiosk mode may help as well (using kids mode app atm - also solve settings screen access)  Would like to see more options for time allowed settings.

com.mcafee.security.safefamily,A Google user,"This has worked very well for my kid, he already has a good foundation for what 'acceptable use' is for his device, so Safe Family really only serves to remind him that he's overtime, and we've never had problems with circumvention.   I'd love to see a couple more features though: 1. In addition to clock based restrictions, and app specific time limits, I'd love to be able to also say 'a total of x amount total device usage today (sum total across all apps)'.  1a. Maybe 'this app is always available even after or outside of total use hours'. For apps like Kindle or other 'educational' or functional apps.  2. Display total time an app was used in the audit log, instead of just when it was started. It's already counting it for the app based time limit, so I'd like to see it in the UI.  My only real criticism at this time is that sometimes it takes a bit before a request for time is received by my device. And the fact that it pesters periodically to approve or deny that request is annoying. On more than one occasion I'm received requests hours later that are just re-send of one I ignored earlier. Just means I have to make sure to answer the request every time, not that bigga deal.  Thanks for a fairly solid free app. Nothing else on the Play store like it that I've seen that doesn't have a monthly fee associated. And even those have mixed reviews.

com.mcafee.security.safefamily,A Google user,This app is nice and a much better interface then some of the others. Mames my eyes happy to look at rather then these apps with no design thought. But this app is missing in my opinion a big feature. That is to see all the text nessages sent and received to the device. Not 3rd party apps but direct messages like texts and images sent and received through mms. The app I was using before had this and kind of makes me want to switch back. Im just hoping Mcafee team sees this and decides this is a good feature  UPDATED: 3/26  App is lacking many features. You can only control screen time in groups not by day. Is always saying my son is changing the time on his phone even though hes not. My son figured out how to get by the lock out screen afterhours in a couple days hes 12. If a 12 year old can beat Intel/Mcafee security that quickly this app deserves negative stars and intel and mcafee need to get themselves out of the security industries as it obvious they have failed here.,1
com.mcafee.security.safefamily,A Google user,This is a God sent app...

They can learn the value of privacy when they turn 18-21 and out of my home but for now I'm checking everything.... And that's what some of you parents out there need to do...

com.burockgames.timeclocker,Kalin Malchev,Great app that has helped me manage my device usage and time substantially. I really like that you can add a pin to prevent unblocks but knowing your own pin can make the feature a bit redundant. Cold Turkey blocker has a feature where to unblock you have to manually input a randomly generated string with x amount of characters. This creates a lot more friction as it's a tedious task and prevents easily unblocking applications. I think that sort of feature would be great for this app.,5

com.burockgames.timeclocker,hassan azam,It's great if your want to stop using your phone or are addicted to it. You can block apps after the time limit you set. For example 1 hour for YouTube then it blocks it for the rest of the day. And you can also make a note for yourself i.e dopamine reached when it goes to the block screen. It's made me more productive ü§†. THANKS APP DEVS,5

I also have apparently used an app that I only opened at a supermarket checkout to scan (for literally a minute) and it shows I have used it for 23 minutes. The numbers don't add up,3

I used an app for 50 min one day and haven't used it since; my daily average is 50min when it makes more sense for it to be about 1min (Installed StayFree 50 days ago).

com.burockgames.timeclocker,Emma Stevens,"It's fine, but not fantastic, and the UI could be better. When you click ""delay 10 minutes"" after your time limit is up, it doesn't delay it by 10 minutes but just continues blocking you from the app whilst saying you used 10 mins. So it says I used instagram for an hour today when actually it was 20 minutes that I used it for. It also often blocks apps late (say 14 minutes instead of 5) or doesn't at all, and sometimes doesn't send notifications. For counting time this app is great though.",3

com.burockgames.timeclocker,‚Ä¢Klara Lov≈°e‚Ä¢,I love it. But there's just one thing I'd like you to add. When the application is blocked because of the limit I sometimes cheat and change the timing so I add extra minutes. It'd be great if I couldn't do that. So when the application is blocked I can't change the timing for that day anymore. Anyway It really makes me realize I spend way too much time on my phone and that I need a break. I've also been noticing lack of concentration and stress so I'm trying to change that with this app.,4

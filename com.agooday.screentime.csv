com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,"Love the UI, but less keen on the persistent notification (I understand why it's there, but similar apps do the same thing without it). Also, I'm not sure exactly what this app considers a session for an app, since it tends to show way, way more sessions than there actually are. Example: By 14:30 today, Usage Time showed 21 sessions of an app I use once an hour to track my day ‚Äî I'd opened it 5 times at that point ‚Äî and 6 of those mystery ""sessions"" were all time-stamped 13:55. I *was* in the app at 13:55, for about 30 seconds. Then I minimized and swiped it away. Also, emailed the developer 9 days ago with a couple questions, but haven't received a reply.",3

com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Thanks for your great app. I think this app would not work for some apps for example I have whatsapp and whatsapp business in my cell phone but the limitation did not work for whatsapp business at all! Could you please help me?,4
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Inaccurate,2
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,"Works well. Wish I could keep track of a longer period of time though. It would be helpful to compare usage between months. It deletes data past 7 days.

com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,"Very Inaccurate, sometimes it shows no usage, and other times it shows that I've used my phone 28 hours. How can i use my phone for 28 hours in a day ( i live on earth by the way). If the app makers care even a little, please fix this issue. I'll provide the screenshot amd all the info available to me.",1
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Feel as necessary..,5
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Do not download this app! I downloaded it and it automatically signed me up to a premium subscription service without my knowledge. I have cancelled the subscription and uninstalled the app but now have to try and get my money back.,1
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,"I really do love this app it works for everything and shows the notifications and the time you were using the device, the only problem is I forgot my pattern but I have no idea how to fix it!!!

Pelase respond and help me!!",5
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,awesome!,4
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Downtime doesn't work unless you pay anymore. Is just a screentime app which most phones have embedded :/.,1
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Recently started tracking system UI which makes it kinda inaccurate and often makes it say I have 18 hours of usage time,4
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,It is good but it's fake i just got 8 hours on phone and it said that it is 16 hours,2
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Super,5

com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Great app,5
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Great app does what it claims and much more!,4
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,"I got this app in the hopes it would stop me going on social media after a certain time. However, it is quite useless as when I click on one of the apps to use and it's the time or past the time I set it to lock, it gives me an option right there for me to go on the app. I expected the app to be locked until the time I put for it to allow me to use it but it doesn't. It warns you once that it's on lock but then if you click the app after that there's no warning and it just lets you use it",2
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Waste of money. There are other free apps that have even better features.,1
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Nice,4
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Good app. One of the best social media monitors available.,5
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Don't have time count for apps,3
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Its a good app which does it's job but quite often it seems to double my usage time For example today I had a usage time of 7 and a half hours but it's turned to 15 hours at midnight My sibling check my screen time everyday and this doenst really show an accurate example of the real thing,3
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Does a good job but it keeps including the system UI in my time usage so I apparently used my phone 22 hours the last day when I had not even need awake that long,1
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Said I used 26 hrs on my phone for a day I left it at home.,1
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Useful,5
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Just need a clock always on screen and a reminder when we exceed our usage otherwise it is awesome,5
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,This app gives detailed accounts of your app usage and literally lives up to its name! An amazing tool to help restrain oneself from being glued to their screens! Kudos to the developper,5
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Ok,5
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,I paid money for this app so I could use the custom range feature and when I tried using it it won't tell me the hours I've used my phone other than the last week therefore meaning the monthly tracking is also broken. This is really annoying as I need to use these longer term tracking functions for my Chinese learning.,1
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,"I tried to set up the Downtime feature in this app, but it hasn't taken affect on any apps on my phone that I didn't allow access to use during the time allotted.",1
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,It was terrible,2
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,"Great app with interesting stats. Easy to use and read! Tip for @devs - Did you think about possibility to run export for last week / month / since the beginning ? It might be interesting for someone to see how often they take phone into their hands, etc.?",5
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,very disappointed,3
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,"I can't watch statistics for time more than 1 months (by the way, I bought premium for this broken feature). Lack of visual presentation statistics, only pie and bar charts.",3
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Good,4
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,"Great app! Does exactly what is says it's supposed to do & it's super simple interface it only makes it easy to navigate & explore but to my surprise it was actually kinda fun to see my usage time for each app as well as when I used them & other interesting information! I can limit my screen time.+ I was unaware that someone had been getting into my phone, this app showed me the # of times my device had been unlocked I immediately knew someone had been in it. So XTRA THANX 2 THE DEVELOPER(S)",5
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,nice app very useful,5
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Its the worst app that ever exists mi father put me time limit now I can't not play more than 20 minutes,1

com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,I like this app.It is helpfull.,4
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,It works well and has lots of useful functions. Two complaints are that: 1. There is something wrong with the off time setting so you can't actually pick the hours you want. 2. They should add an option to exclude specific apps from your screentime total.,4
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,very use full and it can help,4
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,this app doesn't work properly it just shows the different types of options but they really don't work,1

com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,"I've been looking for an app for a while that let's you on apps for only specific amounts times each day and this is it!

com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Why does system UI keeps showing up on the usage time. It gives a completely wrong picture. This has to be deleted.,3
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Would not recommend. I've had this app for a while now and it only really tells you how much time you've spent on your phone once you're on the app and usage time limits don't work. It drains your battery as well.,1
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,very nice app.,5
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,4 star due to less analytical data presentation,4

It has downtime and you can limit certain apps during certain times however i have not been able to change the ending time to pm instead of am.

com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,pls update battery consume level when 100 to 0 level and each app how much of battery consume also mention and custom time to time usage time check i mean today 3.00am to tomarrow 3 am apl usage and battery consume every thing,4
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,"Bug #1: Usage limits are unreliable and only check when you switch apps. For example, today it told me I'd exceeded a 3hr30 usage limit when I switched to an app but also says I used the app today for 4hr40. Bug #2: Downtime doesn't work if your downtime period spans midnight (eg. if you set 10pm to 6am, downtime only works until midnight).

Pretty similar to the iOS built-in Screen Time, except that you're opting in and have more control over what you want to use / see / limit.

com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,overall I am satisfied that I am able to control my phone ardictions,5
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,Great app but for annoying hour glass notification which is the wrong colour and is sometimes invisible. It's overkill to have both this and the 'unlock device x times' notification. I'd prefer a screen on timer there than #of times unlocked. Also option to increase font size. When new version is installed app doesn't restart itself. Promising but needs work.,3
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,must try,5
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,"I like this app, but there definitely is room for improvement. It'd be nice to get a notification that tells me I've reached my limit in a particular app without my having to close that app and start it up again. And I like the 'remind in 20min' feature, but it didn't actually remind me 20min later. I also think it'd be cool to have a timer for the app you're using in the notification tray alongside the unlock counter, but I think that'd be more flair than necessity. Good app though, I dig it.",4
com.agooday.screentime,A Google user,"Basically useless, since the clock app always shows up as using the most time. About 4 hours every night. Which is also ironic, since this apps name is screen time, and my screen is turned off for the whole duration it logs as screen time.",1

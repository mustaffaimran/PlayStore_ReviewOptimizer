com.appbuck3t.screentime,Aman Bohidar,Its the perfect app for limiting use of apps especially for students preparing for competitive exams. I had tried various apps but this is the perfect app which i needed.,4

com.appbuck3t.screentime,Holly Lanctot,"This app would be great, except for the fact it doesn't block notifications from the apps you block, therefore I still get messages that come through and still see alerts for distracting apps which doesn't help my focus.",3
com.appbuck3t.screentime,Suresh Kumar Pradhan,Just amazing. The focus mode is a boon for students. Thank you so much for providing focus mode for free. I am using this app from November 2021 ( 5 months). God bless you ‚ò∫Ô∏è,5

com.appbuck3t.screentime,Youssra H.,"Tbh its actually good after using it for 2 days. Initial set up and pop up adds went rocky. And not to forget that it took hours before it recognized I bought premium. Stats and graphs are really good. Tracking time ect.

com.appbuck3t.screentime,PSIHOPEDIA,I've just installed it and seems to be a good app. I wanted to check how much is the premium version (so I can get rid of the ads) and I can't figure if the amount I'm paying is for a month or an year. Let's go with 4 stars for now.,4
com.appbuck3t.screentime,Unekwu ojo Abraham,The best,5
com.appbuck3t.screentime,Mike R.,"Disgusting amount of ads. Couldn't do anything without multiple popping up that hide the close button, try to trick the user, register any tap as a desire to install the junk gambling apps, etc. It also demands your fingerprint. Plus, the app itself, once you get to it, also lacks basic features. Shame on the dev for this garbage.",1

com.appbuck3t.screentime,GG S,"Pretty sure it's engineered to steal info. It asks for overlay permission, sure... Then after you give it that it tries to get your finger print for some reason. It looked jank so I skipped. It immediately popped up an ad, and after navigating away from the the app was completely blank. I.e. no ui, no functionality, no nothing.

Set an app to 1h per day, and it started shutting me out at 30m, it even confirmed in the details that it had been 30m. Then every time I would click settings, it would open a video ad. Essentially every time you touch this app you get a 15s video ad. Not worth your time, try another time saving app.",1

com.appbuck3t.screentime,Sylvia Ngari,"Hi, Hope you are having a good week and keeping safe. I realized that the app stats are dependent on my launcher. Is it possible to have the app independent of the launcher? My device has 1gb ram so sometimes it just hangs restarts by itself. I use Microsoft launcher and they have some sort of screen time monitor. Each time my phone restarts, the Microsoft screen time data gets erased and so does the data on your app. Kindly if possible make the changes.",3
com.appbuck3t.screentime,R Name,"This App is good for blocking specific Apps after the amount of time you specify each day. However the modify function (adding additional usage time for an App after it's been blocked) doesn't work reliability. It sometimes just continues to block the App. Additionally I don't see a way to block an App entirely (0 minutes of usage) so had to set a bunch of them to 1 minute. Finally, what is the Focus setting? There is no explanation included. We haven't tried Premium features.",4

com.appbuck3t.screentime,Afia Boadu,"Literally 5 stars for this app. I just got it today and it works perfectly. I am much more focused and it allows you to add work intervals for each day. Super good, and the times don't only go up to 2hrs max like some other apps. It even gives you stats when from before you even installed the app. Kinda weird but cool. Amazing app though, but only criticism is it takes long (about 30 secs) for the notification to appear that the app is blocked. But definitely recommend.",5

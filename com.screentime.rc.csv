com.screentime.rc,Nikola Kelovic,Solidna aplikacija sa puno mana.  ne mogu se limitirati svi dodeljeni uređaji zbirnim limitom već svaki uređaj zasebno. svaka aplikacija koja se doda je dozvoljena umesto da po difoltu bude zabranjena. Dobra osnova ali se mora popraviti.,5
com.screentime.rc,Tali Luvhengo,Every few days you can't login to the parent app. Which sucks because we paid money. App support is absolutely poopy. No communication at all. App works amazing when it works. Best in the app store.,1

com.screentime.rc,fatema hiridjee,"Probably the worse service ive had so far. Been charged for subscriptions that are not even compatible on our phone, none of these where mentioned when subscribing. I dont even understand why I was even charged in that case. When I cancelled my subscription à day later, I was invoiced. Screetime doesnt refund. I personaly feel this is rip off :( and i would absolutely NOT RECOMMEND this service. Customer service is very average.",1

com.screentime.rc,Russell Metcalfe,At first this app was great did all tat I needed so I bought premium but slowly little things were going wrong like my kids phone would pause for no reason or it would block apps that I hadn't set up to be blocked so not so good after all they happy to take your money but couldn't fix the issue,1

com.screentime.rc,Wayne Bethell,"Very patchy on whether it tracks or not. Sometimes logs thr time, sometimes just allows unmetered usage. Even with apps blocked just opening and closing them a couple of times seems to confuse the app and let the child use. Not great",1
com.screentime.rc,Rebecca Tosin,"The app was initially good,but later even if I blocked an app my child was able to go on the app I blocked A big issue is my daughter can put her phone on safe mode and she is able to use 2 of the apps I blocked.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Excellent app, helpful and useful. Mostly if you have, like me, sons 11 /12 years old, it allows you to understand how and how much they use their phone. To recommend! after 5 years, lots of disconnection with my kids device. lots of troubles in the last year... I'm sorry guys, but my review has necessarily to go down to 2*",2

com.screentime.rc,KC Lim,"This is a scam and I felt so cheated! I subscribed to the premium subscription including all the extras for a year. 6 months on, my child changed her device from Android to Apple. The app can no longer track the stuffs it claimed to track and caused my daughter's device to hang. I cancelled the subscription and asked for the refund of the remaining months not utilised. They said no and no reason was given. Totally unfair practice!!! Very poor customer support. Do not subscribe to this app!!!!",1

When I'm on an app it blocks, even when I open my phone, and access an app, it blocks. I can't make phone calls or send messages. All apps are completely blocked and I can't access them at all. I have to restart my phone and wait 30 minutes before the app stops glitching and I can access my apps again. Really annoying, it's awful. Please fix this!!!",1

com.screentime.rc,ashley Caton,I hate that you have to pay for additional features and on the kid's device they can just switch it off without the app notifying the parents. Google Family Link is far superior but yets hard to put on apple phones.,2
com.screentime.rc,bad dreamz,"There was a sheriff at my door. I had to call my mom so she could come. I couldn't because this dumass app kept saying ""Sorry, you cant use split screen!"" So I had to wait until my parents got home and explain why I didn't call them, so I said it glitched and I couldn't call them. I tried restarting my phone, after 10 seconds it will start spamming my phone with ""Sorry, you can't use split screen!"" again. Im deleting this bullsh. Also, stop copy and pasting the same goddam message to reviews.",1
com.screentime.rc,Matt Seritt,"It's easy to setup on android. It's a pain for iPhone. Works pretty good an android. So far, for my son's iPhone, It's spotty. Recommend somewhat.

com.screentime.rc,Mista Lewis,This app was working perfectly until I tried adding a second device. I have an android device that was tracking another android device. The device recentĺy added is an apple device. And for some reason the app stops tracking the android device and is only tracking the apple device even after deleting the apple device from the profile. I have paid for the premium version of this app and for what? This app was working perfectly for weeks after upgrading to premium. How can this be corrected!?,1

com.screentime.rc,Elizabeth Tsirigoti,"Love, love, love this app. I use the paid version but the free version is excellent, too. That said, this app needs a way to limit time on an individual app – say, Facebook or Instagram, for example. Something else that would hugely improve the app would be a small countdown timer or warning on a child's screen indicating their availabile screentime is about over and their screen will soon shut down. If these changes were made this app would deserve a 10 star rating from our family.",4
com.screentime.rc,Tia Singh,I love this app.but sometimes it doesn't sync .but still will give it 5 star,5
com.screentime.rc,Andrew Kelsey,We've had nothing but trouble. The child devices would frequently not update with new settings from the parental device. Then it rendered one device unstable by saying split screen was not allowed. Couldn't even get into settings on the device.,1

com.screentime.rc,Nicole Meacham,"Non-functional Notifications for each app effected by EACH setting pop up on your child's entire screen and make everything else completely inoperable. You could end up closing 100's of windows and the only option to stop it is to select uninstall on the pop up menu, but that might even take 20 times of selecting that option before the app opens to let you uninstall. The concept is perfect for my needs, but the execution is the worst.",1

com.screentime.rc,Vortexen,"this app is pretty standard, keeps me off screens sometimes, but if you have an iq over 5 you can figure out that all you have to do is force stop it and until you reenter the app it wont track/block u. if youre a good parent you should be able to control your kid not to spend so much time on screens, if they resist at least have them do something good for themselves like learn a programming language or learn to video edit. learn to manage your kids.",2

So if I set chores they have no idea what they are so I have to go I to my app and find out what they are. Pointless to have that if it doesn't function properly. It does help with bed time and minimizing screen time, but could be so much better with very easy coding. It also doesn't have a lock now option. So you would have to change all tour presets if you are qabting to temporarily lock it",3

It showed that my child was at home when in fact he was in class🧐. Also, it's no longer showing the actual time he's been active on his phone. It showed that he's been on his phone 2 days ago, when in fact he was in the living room on his phone🤦🏾‍♀️.

My kids get 1 hour a day, and can get more time doing choirs or other tasks. I can limit, or give them free time. I am able to monitor what they are playing which makes me feel secure in a world of addicted kids on technology. They don't like screen time, of course, but they don't blame me for when their time runs out now. Highly recommended!",5

Android gains you full control and can see all usage etc. Apple still allows all text messages as well as phone calls when locked so not much use for a teenager.

I used the app on 4 devices over the course of several years for my son. He figured out how to bypass the software on all of the devices, when he was 8. He was just glitching out the app, not that he is a hacker genius or anything.

Support will walk you thru how to re-install the profile etc to fix these issues but results always end up the same.,1

com.screentime.rc,Victoria Graydon,"My son is a gamer and loves to talk on the phone with friends while playing online. I have had this app for 2 months now. When my son first got his phone he would miss homework times, pretend to go to bed, and try to stay up and play games on his phone all night. Screentime put an end to that. Now I am the boss again and full control over his device. I can set his bed tim and homework time which makes it convenient for me while I work. He's improving around the house due to screentime.

My only concern is that you can bypass the restricted times by keeping the apps open prior to the set times. As long as the apps are kept open, this app did not do as promised. You have to make sure your child completely clears out their open apps for the phone to completely lock down. As soon as I recognized this issue, everything was fine. IMO the app itself is a overall 3 star rating. As for the customer service, they are fantastic and happy to help! I was promptly answered when inquiring about cancelling my subscription. My kiddos are aging out of parental control and having screentime has overall benefited my family. Thanks! Kind regards, - M",4

My son can reach the limit and the app shows he has been playing with it for 10min..which is obviously not true. I've contacted customer support and they're giving me advice. I did everything they told me to do and the problem persist. I paid for the year but not planning to renewing,2

com.screentime.rc,Jay Berkenbilt,"This is the fourth screen time app we have tried, and while not perfect, it is better than the others. While not entirely tamper proof (none are), this does not suffer from some easy loopholes that some of the other ones we've tried suffer from (like using split screen). Here are some things that I think separate this app from others in the pack: 1) not super-invasive; you don't have to supply credentials for online services; 2) time can be controlled to the minute; some apps limit to 15-minute increments. Great if you're going to be leaving the house in 10 minutes and you want to give your kid another 7 minutes to finish a video. 3) a PIN enables to to make adjustments on the device. Essential if you're on the road and can't connect over the network. 4) The device notices changes to settings quickly. If we block or unblock or add or remove time, the device picks it up faster than other apps. 5) The pricing structure is great. It's nice to know that we can manage time across multiple devices without having to keep paying more and more as we add devices. All in all, I think this is a great product. The kids don't love it -- besides the obvious reasons, they say it interferes with some things, but I think compared to other apps we've tried, it is the least annoying to them as well. One of my kids actually sometimes asks me to block an app (like YouTube) to remove temptation while doing some other activity.",5

The ability to allow kids to accrue more tasks by completing assignments is great! Web control and YouTube monitoring are essential for any shrewd parent. The free version is great. The paid version is phenomenal. This app is practical until age 17 or 18 in my opinion. My kids ages are soon to be 14, 11, and 9.",5
com.screentime.rc,Frankie Tarantola,The app works really great the only thing that should be added or suggested is that you need to somehow have the option to lock the app itself because iv noticed if the kids Uninstall the app on there phone then they can continue to use its as mush as they want even if you set a time or have apps blocked,4

I would like if the app better if it could report what apps she was using, and searches she did instead of telling me how long she was on the phone. I set the limits so telling me how many hours she is on the phone is irrelevant with no data as to what she is doing. Also, after it unlocks my daughter's iPhone, every time all the apps are re-arranged and out of the folders she put them in which drives her nuts.",4
com.screentime.rc,mocha duchateau,App runs late Got my child in trouble a couple of times And it wasn't even my child it was the app. The GPS shows that my son has either left or departed hours after he has already gone on I have picked him up and brought him home and waited for the app to show me that he was home and not at school anymore and it took over and now and a hour.

I would have given 5 stars if you have a feature where you can group some apps and put day and time restrictions in it. And a condition rule (like from Amaz_n kindle) where a specific app can only be access once a person spend time on it (e.g. playing math, reading and educational apps)",4

Minor glitch, you have a lot less control over IOS devices but that is to be expected due to Apple tech/mentality. The level of perfection of this app ..extends to enabling the kids to manage themselves their allowed time usage of internet/mobile. To choose h o w and w h a t they ll spend their allowed time on. and at the same time define which educational mobile apps are always allowed for the kids to use ! (for us it was i.e. google translate, and at last they have a way to be able to check their spelling mistakes!! :) you have a way to regulate , PAUSE any mobile to have a nice dinner together : without breaching in your children's private life i.e ""you don't pry to know the content of the kid's messaging but you get a daily report that ""anna used skype for 3 hours yesterday"" e x a c t l y what is of importance to a parent. and SO many other features that the app offers.

It showed my son as two miles away, yet he was standing in front of me!! It's a great idea, especially when it runs right, but I seem to be having a lot of problems with it lately.",3

Not worth your time or money.",1

When I was using an Android platform I couldn't say enough nice things about Screen Time. However, I have used the app on a couple of Apple Products and can't find anything good to say. Granted my Apple products are older, so that may be part of the issue. I have had NOTHING but problems with Screen Time on Apple. In fact, it is so bad my child doesn't even attempt to use the I-pad anymore. I have reinstalled and even taken back to factory spec the device and the problems still continue. We'd gone months without using the service when I ran into problem with my child on the Apple phone we have, so I installed Screen Time on it. I really regret my decision as it is now unusable. I even completely opened up all the features (as in there are no time limits, no hours blocked, nothing) and that worked for a bit. Now I can't use any apps on the phone at all because it keeps requiring the apps to be 'reinstalled' and Safari loses contact with the site. I have attempted to work through these with issues on the I-pad with their ‘support’ to no avail. Part of that problem is communication, as they are not available when I am on the West Coast of the US. So I send an email and get an answer back the next day, but usually don’t have the device with me as I am at work. So again, another delay. I don’t entirely blame them for that, but it doesn’t leave a good experience. I’d write more, but I have to figure out how to get rid of the app on the Iphone and not lose any data on the apps.",2

I am very disappointed. Especially considering I work with children and families, and for many years I have recommended this app to multiple families. I will never do this again. I have reached out to all of the families to let them know how poorly we have been treated and how they continue to charge us and have never refunded the annual fees even after multiple attempts to cancel our account.

com.screentime.rc,Sarah Karlis,"We wanted something simple to turn off our kid's phone at night to ensure she got a full night sleep (she was sneaking it upstairs off the charger). We don't otherwise set the screen limits on this, since when we're awake we can monitor it better, but the nighttime ""off"" period has been perfect. I also like getting an email with her previous day screen time and what what games/apps she's downloading. It's giving us the data we need to set screen time expectations in our house and make sure she isn't downloading malware-type games or anything else problematic. We're using the GPS function as well, but it's more as a background safety feature than tracking her (since she's in upper elementary school and not a teenager). We'll have to reassess in her teen years to find a balance between ""surveillance state"" and safety, but I really like that this app allows you to turn on or off those features depending on your parenting style and needs.",5

We even stayed with Paid Premium for several months, trying to work out the kinks. STILL, it never worked right. I was constantly troubleshooting it. I sent a couple of requests to support. Many suggestions, but no solutions. I read & reread the extensive FAQ (should've been a red flag) and our frustration increased every day. Then my preteen moved from an Android to Apple. The problems went from bad to worse. Our favorite error screens were 'You should not currently be blocked' and 'There was a problem getting your details, sorry!' and the perennial favorite 'there is a problem with your child's device.' No kidding! It seems the quirks are part of the subscription, to the point where even the FAQ page acknowledges things need more development: 'Are your home screen folders disappearing? Install another app, then mid-installation, restart the device, and the greyed-out icon that appears is correct, but cannot be moved. I spent more time trouble-shooting this hassle of an app than I spent in control of my children's devices. But always looking for a plus side, the task/reward system is brilliant.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Doesn't work. Nothing seems to be working on my child device. They asks for premium version.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I used this app as trial started in April. It was not blocking the apps in my kids phone and she was more than 5 hours using phone inspite of setting 2hour limit.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Really impressive. Super quick to setup and seems to have a lot of relevant controls. I was running Google family link but looked elsewhere due to their all or nothing approach. Well done for this App.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I'm a child this app is horrible children need freedom,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Overall decent app. Precise Location tends to be wrong from time to time,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This has all the features I wanted in a parental app like this.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great tool, stops arguments, saves relationships with kids.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I always have to reset and save the restrictions to apps and times for use each day, and is overall very disappointing.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great App, working perfectly on their tablet but I am unable to add the kids laptop to it. It is a lenovo laptop Kindly assist",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to use. Had to pay for premium to do what I wanted but at least it's not glitchy like other apps. Kids like how they can earn more time doing tasks.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is awesome, i can set time on my children's tabs from my phone.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Reayy a great product for my son's android devices,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works wonderful,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,no more fighting over coming to the dinner table if the tablet don't work then there is nothing to fight about. I love this application.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Confusing interface, bugged system. How to badly implement a good idea...I would suggest the ScreenTime team to try their application themselves. I cannot believe they have done this yet. Selecting time is confusing and takes more space than necessary. It's not clear what is Lights off compare to bed time, and no description is provided in the interface. The worst is the applications list. Clicking on one to select is not reactive, or the list moves up and down while you are clicking, which is very annoying. Sometimes, selecting an app does not work. Some applications contains a useless links ""included in X limits"", which breaks the list and makes it difficult to follow. Instead of this, I would rather have a compact list, with an option to see the description on the application from Google Play. Even the type would be useful: game, music, etc. I realise that my daughter spent 6 hours on her phone, when I set a daily limit of 3 hours. After investigation, I noticed that most new applications (games) she installed where ""unlimited"". Although the geolocation feature is not something I am interested, they keep pushing and spanking the interface to add it. Seriously? If you don't know where your child is, then you have a bigger problem. Overall, a lot of features are more spying than protection on your child. Despite the message below, the team never contacted me not answered my suggestions. It is more a double language than a real concern about customers satisfaction. Worst of all, my child was able to remove the application herself. This application implements badly more than you need, check the others.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I just gave 4 rating since I can not spare Messenger from deactivation since it is so important to communicate with my kid while I am at work. I hope this would be addressed soon!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a horrible app and it doesn't even work on iOS, on my kids iPad. Its turning all of their apps off for no reason and doesn't do it is supposed to do. I want a refund...",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's wonderful to know you can protect your child. I didnt have any trouble login on or pairing. Sofa this application has been just what we needed to help our family stay on track with screen.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I am in love with this application and good application. Are common to all my friends routine. Works as intended.I am very happy that customer service replies within hours.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"EXCELLENT. So far, totally worth the $. Have had it a year on free mode, just upgraded to premium and is working wonderfully. Great help via chat too.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is a great tool that encourages and motivates your kids to help out more around the house. It can be help tool to create more balance with technology and real life experiences.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Has some issues. Periodically the limits just stop having any effect and I have to uninstall and reinstall on my kids' devices and set up all the schedules and limits again. I don't know if it's because of updates on their devices, but it's happened a few times now and usually takes a while for me to realise, until I see one of them still using their phone after lights out, or using an app that should be blocked. In general I'm happy with the app, but it's not as reliable as I would like.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app works great! My kids both have tablets, not phones so it was hard to find a service that would work for them, but this has been flawless so far!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app cannot block the system settings effectively, kids can easily amend and supersede the blocked screens/apps. Wasted my time to install it.",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I really want my dad to download the kids part of the screen time app so the I can control his phone for a while and see how he likes it. It's not fun. I really despise it.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Screen usage has gone waaaaay up in this house during quarantine, and this app gives freedom for that while allowing me to keep an eye on things. Would recommend definitely.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Dzieci tego nie napiszą i oceniają na 0 gwiazdek. Znaczy, że działa. 🙂",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great for Android, awful for Apple. I have no issues using it on an android. It would be great to have notifications (not emails) when my child completes a task & is requesting more time. For Apple, if the kids touch the screen, it locks them out & makes their apps disappear & they have to do some weird steps to get them back but that doesn't always work. It also cuts off the wifi & I have to uninstall the app to get the connection back & the apps. All this renders it useless for apple devices.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome idea but would not work with our family. Would randomly lock apps even when it was running on the kids phone. Wouldn't let them unlock it. It was not from my commands. Read multiple posts and websites to try to fix the issues and they did not improve. I have never had problems like this where I couldn't find a solution or way to make it work. Not worth the headache to download this app.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great way to limit screen time!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So far it does more than any other app I have found. I have high hopes and will update after a while if my review changes.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I like this app but I notice it works better for android my daughter got a iPhone I notice it works differently on her android I could see what apps shes on and how long with each app and an iPhone I dont see that. I only see how long shes been in the phone but not on her apps I find that odd. Everything else is the same just that problem bothers me.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Nothing is for free!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very helpful to get in touch with kid mobile usage details.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Not worth a damn. Need a NO star button.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Rubbish! As soon as I paired it to my daughters phone it started glitching.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Werkt perfect,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I'm on 7 day so called premium trial. It took 3 days for my children to hack this app and increase screen time on their own via email and other methods. Pls dont waste your time on this app.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Everything a parent could ever want! (minus actually being able to read text messages).,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Such a frustrating app. Even after I unsubscribed it randomly times out my son's tablet,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Like the app wuth android devices.. With Iphones its somewhat diffefent,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Screen Time has been a game changer for us, we've set limits so there's no more arguing about how much time our daughter can use her device per day..I've read comments from kids saying how much they hate the app..well as a parent that's how you know it's doing what it's supposed to..The only thing that is missing is the ability to pause or stop individual apps rather then pausing all apps. I would give a 5 if it had that feature.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Nice daily updates of my 2 children's phone use,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Useless as my child always uninstalls kids version on his mobile. I tried all versions including direct APK download from screen time website but my kid always uninstalled it so I'm deleting this useless app.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Pros: PHENOMENAL way to govern what gets installed on your kid's phone. AMAZING ABILITY to enable or disable and set time limits as well as hours for accessibility AT THE APP LEVEL, not just at the overall phone level. Comes with configurable schedules. Cons: Web logs never work, and Screentime blocker pops up on my kid's screen randomly even when only app in use is NOT on any block lists and it's not school hours or bedtime. Doesn't work as well on iPhones as it does on Android",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It was good until my child n her friends realised they can still use when it is on power saving mode. Disappointing,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very helpful for parents. Kids only can stop using electronic devices when parents have full control on them through this App,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This has really helped our family. Not only does it limit to a sane amount of time, but now she can do her chores if she wants more time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Feb 2020 update. Now 1 star. Apple integration is rubbish. On Huawei phones, it keeps on stopping so no idea what the kids are doing on either device. Will be keeping my money as opposed to funding a non developed app. 2018 review:Main gripe is they charge £30 a year but then ask more for Web filtering. For that amount of money, they should throw in the Web filtering. Also needs to be able to track other apps like YouTube etc. Fairly basic application coverage for premium prices.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Not working good,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Very good. But, my sons have found ways to bypass blocked setting on apps and are still able to access them.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's awesome I can control my kid exactly as what I want,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Would routinely allow my son to continue playing certain apps on his phone even after his daily time limit was up. This app is a waste of money. Just use either apple screen time or Google family link to monitor and limt your child, they work better and are free.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Location tracking feature is randomly switched on in parents' app. When child disables location on his device during free time, after locked time begins, screentime children app starts promting for application permission settings screen which allows to uninstall the app. It took a couple of days for my son to find this 'feature' and I'm really upset.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This has changed my relationship with my daughter. We no longer argue over time wasted and shes back to being the amazing kid she IS with the help that this app has given us to break the addiction and keep accountability.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Why im i having to pay after 7 days of usage when its say free,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"A completely worthless program. When it works, it's great. But about every other month it just stops working and my kids have full access to everything. I've had to re-set this up multiple times and it just happens over and over again. Do not recommend!",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Way too many glitches. Never blocks or unblocks childs device at the times we set. We could set to shut off at 5:00p and it wont shut off til almost 530p. Sometimes it shuts off early before the set time. Too easy for kid to ""swipe away"" locking all apps, then the process to get them back doesnt always work. Deleted app, do not recommend.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app. Allows me to control screen time for all my kids. You can schedule times that devices are allowed to be used, preventing devices from being used during school or after bed. You can also set amount of time devices can be used in a single day, or allow kids to earn time by completing tasks. However, an ""Approve All"" option for tasks would be great, as of right now, each task must be approved individually. Doesn't block background apps, like Facebook messenger very well either.",4

I would recommend this app to all parents of teenagers. The cyber world is a scary place and its great to know what your teens are doing or not doing when there head is stuck in there phone!! I love being able to pause her phone!!! 😁,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Forget it. Even to use the most basic function of blocking apps your need to pay for. Used to be able to do that basic function for free. FYI kids can circumvent screen time by going into safe mode. This so used to be real good until everything went to gotta pay, even for basic stuff. Between safe mode bug and always having to resync it.. i gave up on it",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,More issues then Time magazine.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's a great tool for parents, I'm sure a lot of kids hate it, mine did at first. But, being able to monitor what your kids are doing remotely and still giving them SOME sense of freedom eases your worried mind. Apps like these are needed and as long as you are aware that kids (and their friends) are very tech saavy and just check their phones to make sure the app is still running, it's useful. I would love to be able to customize it a little more though, esp for weekday vs weekend.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,i want to use this application,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I’m not super pleased. When I used the trial, I thought it was amazing, but after I purchased it, it’s more of a hassle. Things I don’t like: 1. It appears to suck time from my kids’ daily limits just when the screen is on regardless if they actually have an app active. 2. In the log where it says you can view their usage, it doesn’t actually let you see what apps they were using. This is extremely frustrating because it makes it really difficult for me to ascertain whether or not the kids are being truthful when they say that screen time took their time, but they weren’t on their phones. For example, my 12 year got out of school, and screen time suggested he had already used his phone for almost 8 hours. While I know he was probably on it before school for sometime, he wasn’t on it during his school day. Annoying. 3. If I have the daily limit feature on, I don’t have the option of only having it on for week days. Not a huge deal, but it’s annoying that I need to remember to turn their daily limit off on the weekend. 4. In general, I feel like getting screen time to work harmoniously with my kids’ iPhones has been less than easy. It’s just not as great as I thought it was going to be. At the end of the day, yes, I can shut down all their apps whenever I want to, and that’s great in a consequence situation, but for most days where we’re just trying to manage normal use, it causes more frustration than not.",3

Please can it be fixed!",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Unfortunately, 2 years down the road, I went to the Helpdesk because the school asked students to download a LEARNING APP - SEESAW. I couldn't find it on the apps to unblock it, YET It was blocked. Helpdesk claimed that it was a parental control app, which is why it cannot be viewed in the app blocker. I asked the Helpdesk for a solution to unblock Screentime and if the solution was to uninstall Screentime. Guess what, the Helpdesk just gave me instructions to uninstall the app. Clearly they do not treasure your business. It is at such times that I am happy I pay by the month and don't lose as much, although monthly fees are higher. DO NOT GIVE BUSINESS TO BUSINESSES WHO DO NOT WANT THEM. So disappointed by their lackadaisical attitude to service. See below for my glowing review 2 years ago. =============== The most fantastic app for restricting screen time and building responsibility in your teenager. The best part is being able to set tasks for her to earn extra time on her phone.",1

Too complicated to pay for.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Intuitive and easy to set up and use. Only aspect I'd like to see implemented is being able to unlock a locked phone either from my phone or the child's phone. If there is a way to override the phone lock code through the app, that would be a great addition. Otherwise, being able to control apps, websites, setting a use schedule, it's all a great experience.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"So far so good. Added her ipod also. After she realized her time was up on her android phone, she just moved on to that. In FAQ's I saw that time logged does not get subtracted from both devices. Hopefully they make this adjustment in the near future. So if I set 4 hours, she gets 4 hours on her phone and 4 hours on her ipod. I reset the time limit by half. But it would be nice if they were combined so she felt like she had more control over what device she uses in that 4 hour limit.",4

It's an invasion of privacy and it's just rude. If your parents get this app, talk to them, and speak for the children. Say, ""mom, dad, I am sick and tired of you controlling me and my phone with this stupid app. It makes my life miserable, and if you think screens make your brain all mushy, they don't.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Premium is ""pay after free use or you can't use anything."" Works great, honestly. But after the free period, you HAVE to pay for service else you won't be able to use services that are practically why you tried this app in the first place. Going back to googles similar free app Family Link. This was a waste of time - why start using it with your kids and get everything setup when all services become useless unless you pay? Should've been a lot clearer at the very beginning. 0 stars if I could",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good for screen limits. Downside is that you can't separate the night time lock for different times from the week vs. weekend. Location feature doesn't work very well though. Many times the notices are sent well after my child has arrived at their destination.,3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is awesome app. My high school son love it, he said, mama please use screen time, I can't control myself, I need your help.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Worst app i have ever used,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Fabulous App. Love it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good in some respects but Isn't very accurate. G.p.s worked well and so did the lights out function. However the website history wasn't accurate and the screentime limiter was set for 2hrs per day....yet daily total time spent showing up to 5hrs.I was expecting once the 2hrs was up then device would shutdown. All great functions and potentially a great app if all the functions do as they say.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've had this for a couple of years now. When it works, it's great. But my 13-year-old son soon found ways to stop it working, and so now it doesn't monitor his usage at all. My daughter (11) hasn't tried to hack it yet, but I'm sure she will find a way at some point. Even so, sometimes it stops monitoring her phone completely, and I have to uninstall and reinstall. A pain in the bum, really. I just want to limit their time, and block the worst stuff. It isn't even doing that properly.",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Honestly don't waste your money. I paid for a whole year and this app is ridiculous. Sometimes it blocks things sometimes it doesn't. The tracking doesn't seem to work very well and it will tell me that my kids have departed or arrived and they sitting right by me. When you make changes to what apps they can use or what to block it doesn't always save it. It's a great concept but just seems like a waste of money,1

It won't let me touch the app button and go straight to my personalized info",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"App worked beautifully until the free trial ended and we paid for the full year. Consequently it stopped working and the kids simply removed it from their devices. Update: after additional use of the app I've upgraded the rating as customer support is responsive and helped resolve the issues. Must keep Settings as a blocked app for the kids, but problem is daily limits are for each device, not a total time. Also, the scheduling is a bit restrictive,but customer service says they are working on it",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,What an amazing app!! Has taken the worry and work out of watching over my kids safety and having a peace of mind at the ease of my finger tips. Great app refer it to anyone!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I can easily control when a what my daughter has access to. And I really like the feature that allows them to earn screen time. For example, if she plays outside for a hour, she earns extra screen time. It seems contradictory but she spends less time on the phone with the app than without it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very nice and effective apps.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Cannt use,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Bad,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It has ruined my life. Kids if your parents are downloading this on your phone, just give your phone away and it will cause less stress. It doesn't work very well and glitches all the time. Just go outside and play and try to keep away from your phone. Just please dont get this virus on your phone. NO SCREEN TIME!!!",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It works. I get a certain thrill out of pausing my kids phones, usually the mere threat is enough to bring them back in line. The main use is to provide reasonable boundaries without endless debates. Certain critical apps are left unblocked.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Beat app ever if you have kids that can't put their phones down to do homework, chores,or go to bed on time. Love it!!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,gg.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Overall positive. Works really well on Android devices. I've had it for a month now and it works a lot better than some other apps I've tried. I especially like the total pause feature and the tasks feature. The developer team is also really responsive, helping with problems that came up due to the need to update the app. They really need to include a feature to block the popup view which allows kids to view a smaller screen over the blocked message, which is how my daughter can watch utube.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is essentially good, not great. It has some excellent features but after an initial intro period they become only available on a premium subscription. Simple features such as bed time blocker should be free. Disappointed to discover how useless it is without premium subscription. If it were a more intuitive user friendly user interface I would be tempted to subscribe but it is glitchy and not the most intuitive UI.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"So far, all is good except the need to decide what is blocked when on break. Flashlight, clock, etc. Also individual daily app limits woykd be nice.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is fairly good for keeping kiddos off their phones late at night, and helps to keep certain addictions to certain apps under control, however.. It slows down the phone, and will lead it to crash multiple times, unless... you don't want it running 24/7.",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's a decent app. I would give it five stars if it vxx actually showed what apps are used, and if the location would actually update when its supposed to rather than showing my child's phone in a field 10 miles away when they are in there room on the phone.",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,hate hate hate,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Pretty decent app. Lot's of features that help monitor and control our kids' activities. Really like the Task feature, which allows us to make part of the screen time dependent on the completion of chores. The app also allows us to give the kids some responsibility of monitoring and managing their own time. The app lets us add multiple devices per child, which is convenient, but it applies the time limit to each device separately. That means that if I give my kids 1 hour of screen time, the app gives 1 hour to each device (phone and tablet in our case), effectively giving them 2 hours. This forces me to manually intervene. I've had to set up a schedule which covers their their free time called ""Time's Up"". When I receive a notification that time has expired one one device, I turn this schedule on, effectively blocking all limited apps on the other device. This worked for about a week, until the kids used their new time-management skills to switch devices at 59 minutes, and getting another hour. If the time limit were harmonized over all devices, I'd rate it 5 stars, but I consider this to be a pretty big flaw.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So far we have found superior in almost all areas . I can blocked things that is not kid friendly. Don’t the fault is that because the Samsung S6 has notifications to the lock screen and then kid can respond to them via short messages.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great application to limit the screen time and pause and give extra time for incentive or even specific time. We have tried several other monitoring applications and this is by far the best and most user friendly we have found.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Generally a great app, but the struggle to get it to work consistently on Huawei devices is now making it useless......",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,this is unusable unless you subscribe so this is not a free app just a 30 day trial,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love the time limits and the application blocker and the daily summaries I receive of their usage. I can see two time when he can use his phone and it works great.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It has also become a tool for rewarding good behaviour. I have had it for couple of years and I am satisfied. Our kids tablet you started to get out of hand so we looked around for options and settle on screen time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I specially like that I can give my children the ability to download games and then approve the ones that are appropriate. we explain to our kids in advance why we were implementing this program for their benefit and learning to manage their device time.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good Excellent Marvelous,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,good. but..... I have the full paid version with 2 kids devices and my son is watching too much you tube in his daily limit . i can include you tube in the limit but I can't limit a single app. for instance if he has 2 hrs per day I would like to limit you tube to 30 mins but I can't. I can only set you tube to be a part of his 2 hrs so if he chooses then he can take the full 2 hrs as you tube. I would much rather individual app limits if possible,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app was easy to set up and use and has made tracking my kids internet and screen time really simple. I love that I can set time limits on certain apps and allow them to use others freely.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"probable the best parental app, and time limiting app on the play store, so many features and 6 devices phone or tablet for £5.50 per month is a bargain. o They could improve the gps tracking tho it tells you where the kids are, but you have to move a map pin to add a location to give u a notification of wen your child arrives ,so that part is useless in its current form,you cant add a place by name or postcode , i hope the person who designed that parbgot sacked lol",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Help me to tele monitor my kids with a complete peace of mind. It's easy to use application for everyone especially from the old person it is very easy to understand and easy to use.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Have even show need to the coworkers for their children. Our kids have more freedom with screen time than they normally would have because we can still allowed them to have certain application at certain times instead of just nothing.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's the only one that consistently work and give me the control I have been searching for. if I could make a recommendation I would request that the emergency call feature the mid so that you can to stick who they are falling and not just be free.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We love this application and it is very helpful for me. It is so easy to use and I love the rape communication I receive from screen time about the application.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Especially like assigning task for more Technology time. We used to limit excessive game usage. I can safely let her have her phone with the security I need.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Only concern is giving intensives after every assignment sometimes increase the total user time. Anomor to group applications to limit and allow use of all others unlimited.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I recommend it to all my friends. It is excellent and easy to use application. We are able to limit time spent on mobile for so it needed. It's great to have that control.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Not free parental control app, as mentioned.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,this app is terrible and ruined my relationship with my child and me don't trust this app,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,They do a good job of keeping up with new exploits that kids find to disable the app. Most of the bad reviews come from angry kids.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,very easy awsome,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app doesn't seem to be working well. The daily reports say 0min on phone, child can not complete task, and time limits set do not function. How you fix this? I don't want to pay for something that doesn't work.",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,good,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It good for younger kids. If you want to read text messages you wont be able to do this on this app. But I did like this app. I locked my kids phone many time when she didn't do her chores! Hahaha,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"If I could give it a zero I would!!! Installed this on an iPhone 5s and it completely locked it up, luckily I was able to catch in between modes where I could totally reset it. It wouldn't even let me delete the app. PLEASE DO NOT USE!!!!!!",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Its a good concept, but it is poorly made. it takes a very long time for the apps to be enabled on some devices. most devices can bypass screentime by using a secure folder or guest account. The app would work well for young childeren but otherwise its not worth the money",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,easy&efficient,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Am just so happy to have screen time. My son is also used to it that he now doesn't complain anymore about having it. It's very efficient. Keep up the good work screen time,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,great,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,good but unstable,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,i like this app but it still lacks some flexibilty. ie: I wish the app allowed bedtime blocker to be set for AM hours also. There are also times it doesnt work as expected. Customer service is responsive and they listen to suggestions. I like using it.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,good app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,it is abuse,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,time wasting! A technical bug to pair my device and my daughter's that wasted my time.,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"WORST APP OF 2019,doing this to your children is horrible,what kind of monster uses this to limit your child,people would use this app if they don't trust thier kids.SERIOUSLY,sick why would my child suffer because of me I LOVE my children I trust them enough with their devices :/ I HATE this app.GARBAGE!!!",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,nice i only wish i could see who shr calls or what her messages are .,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love the fact that I can have control on my daughters screen time even when I'm not around. And that certain sites can be blocked. I was very interested in the GPS tracking feature but this isn't accurate enough. When checking trips and last seen locations somewhere somehow it's giving wrong locations. If u can resolve this problem I will definitely rate a 5 star. If not I just can't extend the trial because it wouldn't make sense for me. This is specifically what I was looking for.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Don't get this app. It is very simple to evade. Just use a guest account or delete it after restarting the phone, as it takes a few minutes to start working.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We are fairly liberal in our screen time rules, but also needed something to easily track where the kids were out walking around town and to help with some basic lights out times. This app has worked wonderfully for setting guidelines. We also love the use of tasks to encourage good behaviors and remind our children of ways they can help out here and there. It's easy to add more time to their day using the free-play button or adjusting schedules. I don't track what they do too closely, but occasionally take a look. We trust our children, and got this mostly for the GPS tracker (just to know they're safe when not with us; not to track their every move) and as a lights out device. There is much we don't use on it, and after trying a few other apps, found this one was best at letting the kids make their own decisions and still use the device. Other apps restricted too much and made it impossible for us to use existing accounts on various apps because they weren't ""children"" accounts. We haven't run into this with ST and it's one reason we have stuck with and even paid for the full version of this app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works well when it works. Was kind of difficult to install. There are a few bugs that need working out, but I think as long as improvements are being made I will continue to use this app. Other than the bugs, it's a decent app for tracking my daughter's phone use. Please keep making improvements. I am a paying subscriber. I have Android, daughter has iPhone.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,app doesnt work most of the time. so we decided to remove it but then it just blocked everything on the phone.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Geo location issues. Consistently having issues with location even when I'm right next to my child it tells me she is several miles away in other locations and making all these tricks at different times of the day when I know where she is and know she was not at those locations. Their solution is always will have you tried reinstalling have you tried updating basically the old turn it on again off again.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Man, those kind of apps are ridiculous and twisted. It's not the child's fault, it's the parent's fault for not knowing where to set boundaries. Maybe ask the grandparents for help, they are the best parenting generation left honestly. By installing this you'll probably make things worse. You dunno what the Internet means to your child, the internet these days is giving your child acceptance, that was supposed to be your job. Actually talk with each other, communicate, if needed, get some help.",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It does pretty good. It's nice to be able to have the pause function, the ability to block certain things until I an ready for my kids to have access and the time limits. My big problem is that the bed time blocker does not work it will block everything even if not selected and recently i had to uninstall it because it had blocked something as bed time even after i had turned off all the blocks.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"In general I like the app. I'm having a glitch with the ""lights out"" portion. Apps I wanted to leave active are still shutting down at ""lights Out"". Other than that I enjoy this ap. This ap is not an ""end-all"" prevention to keep your kids from doing and looking at things they shouldn't be. An intelligent child can easily find ways around the perimeters of this ap (an any ap). In my opinion this ap is good for kids that need to be made aware of HOW MUCH time they are spending on their phone and to help teach them how to manage their time more wisely. ,",4

Takes multiple tries to get anything to save, and then it often reverts to the old schedule a few days later, anyway. And the inability to set different apps than the phone default as emergency contact exceptions is another failure. Also blocks things like Facebook half the time during unrestricted hours as a ""dual app"".",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We have very active (and somewhat responsible) twins.  Scree Time is the perfect solution so we can track their usage and make sure they complete chores/tasks.  The picture feature in tasks is great to be able to see ""clean room"" and a ""do dishes"".  We have one Iphone 6 and one Iphone 5.  Both work great with the app after a some tweaking.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is so far the best on the market from what I have tried.  It definitely has its difficulties with setting up the phone of your child but it can be done.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We use this along with Bark. We sat our 13 year old daughter down after grounding her from her phone due to some pretty upsetting content and language found. We explained that we want her to have access to her friends and be able to responsibly use her device but there are scams and predators out there and we want her to be safe. These 2 apps have made all the difference in the entire experience. She is happy with it and knows she can't just do anything she wants on her device. I have been waiting for something like this to come along.  Let's face it. You are giving a pretty young person access to the entire world including the ugly underbelly of the internet. Would you drop your kid off in a New York train station by herself and just leave her there and expect everything will work out? Of course not.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,good for me to create my sons to be honest..😉,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I found this app very useful and has helped to regulate my daughters mobile  use quite regulated. Only concern is giving intensives after every assignment sometimes increases their total user time. ...other wise this is a good app,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,it is totally bad I would give it poo stars but the app did not let me,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Seemed good until my daughter discovered one of the many hacks, she can now temporarily disable screentime and reactivate it as and when she chooses without me even knowing. so I'm left still paying for something that is useless. I'm looking for a new software to keep her safe now.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Good concept but falls short, settings dont stick, and some options don't always work. You need to check regularly as apps seem to get unblocked and bedtime settings continually change. Update: Contacted support via email on the 26th no response as of yet.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"good aplication,but with room for improvement",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"expensive. app does nothing without paying for premium. you get 14 days free trial after that you have to pay. definitely not free, if you dont want to pay for it dont waste ur time.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app is great. We are able to limit time spent on mobile, per so if needed. Great feature is the tasks and minutes reward system.. really nice. One minor note, we noticed that some times when we edit the time limit, that the field would rest when we leave the field.. not a show stopper at all.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,the app worked on and off the entire subscription...one minute I can see what my son is using or googling and the next minute I couldn't. I'm done trying with this subscription,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,very usefull app,5

You can also pause their device for any reason (chores, playing an instrument, homework or just because) plus you can see what apps they are using and which ones they downloaded. I feel it is worth the small fee to have full access to everything it can do",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This has removed a lot of conflict for me personally. I am able to regulate my son's use of his devices without physically needing his cooperation, which means I can walk away from a situation. The only thing that would make it better is if I could share one period of time over different devices which on the android version doesn't work. I have managed to find away around this though, but a bit fiddly.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Unfortunately is not free as they say,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"frustrating experience lately. I had a pleasant experience with it so far, until this year. I cannot get the app to work on my kid's device even after pairing it immediately. it would work for a while and then disconnect somehow. The updates do not seem to work too. and I paid a premium for this?",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It doesn't work on many android devices, and settings will reset periodically, new save button seemed better however issue still unresolved, support asked client to change devices instead of fixing the issue, they refund on the unused period, advise if its not working immediately arrange refund to avoid wasting money on app doesn't work",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,not works,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We all know that technology is everything and you literally cannot keep it from your children these days but with this application you have so many options. Keep rocking as always and keep it up.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is free application and allows current to be able to lower the amount of time a child paints with their device. this application help children develop healthy habit of less screen time and more play time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,this is the worst app ever its ok on the parents phone but the kids one I can't remove it and i am scared of it cuz I think it can go to your personal data so people please read this and dont download it please,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,You can add a barrier in browser so your kid cannot be able to access adult websites and it really help me out. I was very afraid about such thing because there is a lot of bad things available on internet nowadays.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Such an amazing application. With the help of this we can handle the time spent on phone by kids. I like this initiative. best parental application and I just love this application a lot and thank you so much.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I recommend this for my parents who want to give their child time in a Phone or tablet but only want them to access to certain applications and not the whole of the Phone or tablet.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,overall very happy and my only suggestion would be to be able to use my fingerprint to unlock it. Love it and I wish it would block the tablet from casting to other smart devices but otherwise it make me feel safe allowing the usage of the tablet when I can’t constantly watch it with them.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I really like the pictures of this application. I love that I am able to add exactly what application I want the kids to have access to and there is not a lot of extra junk in the application like others I have tried.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This doesn't work correctly. My son has some how found a way around it even when I have the entire phone on pause. If he has a shortcut to Chrome on the homescreen he's able to get on the internet. Paid for the year but I will not be using again.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,oo 11:32 pm sunday,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love It!! Helps me manage my sons phone exactly as advertised. Great value.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love the app, specially the option pause and the cell of your child will pause in second. the only thing I give 4 options is the GPS that I think is not accurate when it shows his route, it shows mine , and there is confused.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,dident give option for x box ?,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Temperamental. A lot of the times access is not reactivated to child's device. So I end up giving full access with no time limit knowing anything else will interfere with time she is allowed on device. Screentime seems to get itself in nested knots if you have your own schedules and then try an do a blanket 'no access'. Still stick with my original comment of 'temperamental'.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app/the company should specify the system specs they require. There is nothing about this and I first tried to run Screen Time on Android 4 where it simply did not work. It works fine on Android 10. Customer service is excellent. Screen time has huge issues on Huawei phones though. After having tried it for several weeks, I am now looking for a parental control app that works on Huawei.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,good app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,so far works well and customer support is great.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is a great tool to manage my child devices I love it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,downloaded on android phone and ipad to limit sons screen time. I wasn't able to pair the two despite being told I should be able to. The app has taken over the ipad and my son can't play anything on the ipad now. My fiance tried and couldn't get it to work either. No one is happy right now.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have no problem stop sending me emails here's you give stars ☺,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,good for the first few weeks then everything u u used to do for free turned into u need premium account so annoying the ad said free yal right it definatly free,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,great and helpful app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It mostly works, but it's frustrating to say the least. Blocked app settings for schedules aren't saved if you do it in the app, you have to use the web interface. It's not possible to have overlapping schedules, even if the colliding schedules are inactive. I want to set different schedules for summer, but then I first have to delete my winter schedules. Makes no sense.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,suddenly stopped working on my son's phone I kept emailing asking for help telling them every time what phone he had. they replied every time with how to help on a completely different phone which was completely unhelpful!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Fantastic app. Affordable with good features. I have scheduled times in for my 13 year old. If not for Screentime, she would be on her phone non stop.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent tool to control screen time for kids. All can be done fully remotely which is key plus here.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"1 hour limit works only the day you set it, next day its free to play...",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I downlanded this app because my brothers phone is outdated so it doesn't have a screen time management. It worked great at first, but after a few weeks, it doesn't even let me turn on the scheduled times that's he's not supposed to be on his phone unless I go premium. I thought this app was supposed to help everyone not grab your money to get what it promises to do. If it was going to be like this, you should've just made the app available for download after paying rather than in app purchase.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I liked the thought of the app, except it has flaws that prevents unlocking and locking of apps with ease. most the time I go to unblock an app I need to do it 10 times. really annoying",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Im really not satisfied with the app at all its supposed to be an app to lock your childs apps and get them off their phone i paid to lock her phone with this app because shes always on ut but when it locks she has the option to ignore the time limit lock and keep playing on her phone i feel like it is a waste of money take off that option and do not give them an option to ignore the time limit or the locks i dont see the point if they can just ignore and stay on their phone really not happy dad,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I used to think this app was great but I can no longer send my daughter additional screen time which is very frustrating. No this is still not resolved. I've reinstalled it on my phone and my daughters, I still can't send her free time. If she goes out and I want to turn bed time blocker off it doesn't update her side and so she can't access her phone. Given I PAY for this app I would not recommend it. Too many glitches. Please email me instructions to uninstall app, I'll try something else.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Cant even download it! SUCKS!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,good app.. wish for a feature that will pause automatically with user defined interval,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,lol I'm a kid and its helping a lot with my habits!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"No, this is terrible, if a parent didn't teach their kid to put down the phone themselves than this won't help, the kid can easily uninstall it, and we're in an age that alot of the kid's friends are on social media (Twitter/Instagram/ect) just locking the kid outta the phone would be a bad idea, if i saw my kid and they wouldn't put the phone down, then it must be my fault for weather ignoring them or not interacting more than a parent.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,What is wrong with you people. Leave your children alone. They won't trust you anymore. Let them have a life. Don't be creepy helicopter parents.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does what I want it to,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great! Worth the money! We use this to limit excessive game usage. Able to allow and block specific apps, plus restrict usage when it's bed time. LOVE THIS!!!!!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"love It! had an issue early on, developers worked with me to get it fixed. I use it as currency for chores and good behavior.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Has some major flaws; does ok Initally, we liked this app. However, it has some major flaws. Within an hour or two, my son had figured out a way around the limits. The biggest flaw is that if your kid has more than one device, it gives each device the full time. So, I had put that my daughter could have 3 hours. Well, it gave her 3 hours on her phone & 3 hours additional on her tablet. I contacted developers, they know it's an issue & dont have plans to fix. Suggested workaround sucks!",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works well for what I needed and give myself freedom on his phone why I can still monitor his activities and shirt his phone down if if he giving me attitude. Which is the best thing for it..,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love the time limits and the app blocker and the daily summaries I receive of their usage. I highly recommend this application to parents and especially parents who are working.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I do this internet tracking was better with Chrome or other browsers outside the devices natural browser that’s pre installed. Oral application is very good and I am very impressed with it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It’ll so nice to show him how much time he is really on and work out when he can lay off. Love the test section and my kids have to get there work done before they can request more time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this application and if anything continues to work correctly then this will continue to be the go to parent application. This application is a specially designed for the parents who are working.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,no arguments and kids choose to spend less time spent on devices and homework done before they even ask to use devices. All these positive things are done due to this application only.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Doesn't even download on this phone,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Good! It's kind of comforting to know that my parents can keep me safer online with this app. My parents don't set harsh limits, either, and when they do it reminds me to do other things I love like drawing, photography, and playing the ukelele. Thank you guys :)))",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is so great! My kids are more selective with their screentime now. They don't have their phones constantly in their faces. It makes it so easy to stay on top of them.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"well so far it's been a lot of help, but it could be better. Perhaps it could have a way for us to know who they text or call and the times.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Really recommend this product and the annual subscription is very reasonable to and worth to take the subscription. This application is awesome and it allowed me to protect my kids.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,its awesome,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,the kids can just delete the app from their parent's phone,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app does exactly what it says. Works great getting a parent to regulate content and screen time. YouTube really is not for kids. So much questionable content. Worth the money to make sure my kids aren't viewing things they are not supposed to. love the app!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,my kids hate me now.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The minimized App cannot be detected. This is a new functionality in Android, when App is shown on half of the screen. Kid can watch video all day long without time limit and without statistic recordings. Please fix this!",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,good app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,doesent even work oh and yeah you destroyed my life with a app finder and only kids go on play store xD,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,terrible!!!!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My first report said they were on their phones for 2 and 14 minutes! Not even close to being correct. Doesn't say what apps they were on and won't locate them. It literally isn't working when though it connected to both phones,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Worst app ever don't even install it,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"So far it's working. It didn't stop the screen time the first night but I came to find out, that the software must be used on a server somewhere that must be in a different time zone than me. I had to set the timer an hour before I wanted it to turn off, so it would actually turn off on time for me. Odd. Other than that, it does what I need it to do",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This App is a Virus to children,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,fantastic way to monitor my child's internet/ screen time,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Definitely worked better when my kids had an Android, a waste of money for an iPhone.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Ruined my life,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Handy app but had allot of flaws. It keeps coming up saying there is a issue with the phone which means none of the apps can be used. You then have to go through a long process on the phone. My daughter found a temporary way round this by turning off vpn. Will be removing the app as it's not reliable.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"app would have received 5 stars, but falsely made me believe it was free. l understand that the premium parts of the service should cost, but after u get comfortable with the free part of this app, it flips on you and tells you that in order to continue you have to buy the premium package to even use the free stuff. it was a good app until it tried me like that. uninstalling right after this post",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,easy to use. no fuss from my pre teen. i love the pause button option,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"really good app for regulating kids screen time. very customizable and easy to use. the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't allow the kids to text when locked. Most of the time when we want our son to come home or need to check on him, we send him a text. it does however allow the child to use the phone for emergency. I signed up for the 6 month package so we will see how it goes.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is very good app for the parents. Excellent,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,great,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is terrible. it works the way it's supposed to but after i unsubscribed to it and removed the app from my son's tablet, it locked him out of everything. There is no phone support and WE HAVE TO WAIT for chat to reply at their leisure. Stay far away from this app!!! Update: I received the e mail But no it isn't work, it made everything worse! The instructions are useless. Now the apps won't appear at all! Buyer beware: DO NOT USE THIS APP. If you try to uninstall it you'll lose all.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"had no problems with it, but today my child managed to uninstall it on his phone and not happy with how it managed to, was only by me checking his phone I noticed, i never had a message to say it was uninstalled or anything, I was under the impression it was a device admin and couldn't be uninstalled with a password and I would recommend that if it been asked to uninstall a message or email should be sent to the parent that can then allow it so the parent has to confirm it on their phone",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It stops when ever it likes I don't have control over this sucks,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,it does exactly what I need it to. our daughter is more engaged in the family and no more late nights!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I personally like to just use this to monitor the time used on their phones. If they do to much screen time, I discipline them in person. It's better than just pausing them as it gives the children more freedom / autonomy and allows them to learn a lesson (i.e learning priorities) I feel like this app is more for parents who can't discipline them or such. Some children also have diseases that prevent them from being more active (i.e asthma)",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It was easy to break through my parents put this on ad i uninstalled it within a short period of time but if you can stop that it would be pretty good i guess i am on android,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is great!  This helped eliminate any arguing about how much time he gets each day.  I can also make adjustments if he does chores.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Our son and I tried out this app for the week of the free trial, but it didn't work. It didn't limit his time. While his showed a descending amount of time left on his kindle7, on my app on a Samsung S8 it showed no time used. His online time never worked, only gave him 15 minutes more for a ""good deed."" I really wish it would work. Thought I had found a great app.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,the kids could easily uninstall the App even the version that downloaded from the official website. I the video screen minimize the App cannot detect and count the time of usage.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,There's just too many bugs for this app to come even close remotely close to functional. I wish someone could put an app together to do what this app claims it will do. Support seems pretty lackluster as well to top it all off. This app performs like a beta release not a finished product.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,no longer works well with iphone,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,easily hackable.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,sucks. easy for child to disable without parent knowing,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,awesome app to monitor screen time especially for multiple kids who use their devices at diff times of the day. my kids have not complained much as they know im just trying to help them realize the time spent on devices. this is a great option for android since they do not have built in monitoring options. kids can even do tasks to earn additional screen time. i did the 2 week trial and it worked great so im happy to pay the monthly fee. love it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works better for Android NOT Apple. One of my kids has android & I am able to see his apps used & he can't remove the app. On the iphone 6s my other kid can REMOVE the app with no problem & I can't see the specific apps used just the time frame he uses the phone. This app Needs a upgrade for APPLE... ASAP,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Wow,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"When it works it's fine but like many other reviews here unfortunately the basic functionality of synching settings to a child's device has got much worse.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,so far so good...lol! my daughter hates it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works decently on Android and ok-ish on Kindle, but Chrome os needs to be added, and it's in general laggy or forgets settings. The rating is relevant to other apps, because none are particularly good, or even close to great. However, this has some really great features like different schedules, free time for tasks, free play for set times. All these are motivating for children or good for getting them to focus. I especially like that restrictions can be put on apps for for different schedules.",4

I have contacted support but they haven't been able to fix the issue. The app will also randomly remove app blockers, daily limits, and redomly assign free time. Dont waste your time or money with this app. I paid for the premium version.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I use only the free version , and I'd give it 4 stars. However, tonight I decided to go premium. The price says 19.99 $ for six months subscription. As I start to subscribe another, additional cost appears - 0.67$ per month, per device. It's like they intentionally make me feel like I'm being robbed and made a fool of. Had they put 30$ price tag I would have thought ""Pricey"", but I wouldn't feel like a fool subscribing, so now I'm not going to. Not unless my kids really force me.",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We have been using it for more than month and find that settings seems to change automatically. All features are not included - it requires additional payment eg. geolocation. For the money you pay for this app you would expect better. I wanted to pay for 12 months but paid for 6 months after noticing previous review but now realize 6 months is still too long with an app that seems to be still in development stage. I have promoted this app to many people but no regrett it.,2

We whitelisted his music and camera, and use the tasks feature to encourage him to do his chores etc... which gets him extra time. He was resistant at first, but he's gotten used to it and it has reduced his phone usage greatly. And he has found that he doesn't need to use it as much as he thought.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My family of 8 (with kids ranging from 11 years - 14 months) love this app! We have complete control which comes in handy when my older two are with pos bio dad. He and his family would still contact info out of there devices and add in new people I never new and have them talk to my minor children. Just horribly inappropriate in our eyes. The only thing I would like added was a battery detector. So I can see if my kids phones need to be plugged in before it's too late.,5

Definitely not recommended!!!",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I really like the app. The only problem I have is my kid is too smart. He found out that he gets around the parental settings by deleting the app. To prevent this can the pin be extended to the app so it needs to be input before it can be deleted? Please.,5

When there's an extra day off, I go in, turn off the bedtime blocker, and even an hour later the kid's device still blocks at the same time, even while my phone says it isn't blocked.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,the worst,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has helped change both of my son's device behavior. Before using Screen Time my sons were slowly getting sucked into these devices for longer periods of time. Now they know they have a time limit and will put it down to save time for later in the day. When they do run out of time they complete tasks...like play out side or play with legos to get more time...but rarely return to the device because they are busy actually playing!

I don't have any other app that I have to do this with.  3) I have too many others, but let me get to the fatal flaw in this app.  4) This app is completely useless because if you turn the WIFI off on the kids device then nothing you block matters, they can just continue playing.  My kid figure that out fast.  I blocked everything on the kids device to see if this could be prevented and NOPE.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I'm disappointed that you charge for everything when it should be included for the price you already charge. What about a bundle deal? The app is OK but I think there are just as good ones for a better price.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"What to say. It works ok with my daughters phone but it wont work with my sons phone at all.(same model, nokia 3.1) It dosent restrict the apps at all even when i just checked that they should be restrict. Feels like being ripped off by paying over 30€ for a program that doesn't do what it is supposed to do.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have purchased this app over 4 years ago. took a year off it. it is really good. they have great Cs. however I got to be honest if you got a teenage you might want to hold off. the kids can glitch it so they can bypass ALL of the locks. it is great for young kids though and honest teens ( if there is such a thing.lol),4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Had a couple of issues at first, which support sorted sorted very timely. We use it for our teenager to take the temptation away of using her phone into the wee hours of the morning. At 10pm she only has access to her music app. No fights, no 'we'll take your phone away', it just is. perfect!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Like John, i have been using the app for a  year or so and it worked fine.  However now it does not lock apps, if they are open when the timer runs out children can still use the app if it is running.

After months of discussions, arguments, consequences and sneaking around there is not sneaking around Screen Time!  With excellent control down to the app level we can leave the phone functional for email, phone calls and school apps but limit the amount of time spent in other apps (like games, texting, snapchat).  Then at 10pm the device goes into Bed Time mode and at 11 pm the device is unusable.  Now we negotiate with our teen from a position of authority and power.  As an added benefit I can pause the device until the garbage is taken out (NOW is NOW) or Pause the device until he calls me back.

The emergency calls feature shuts itself off, which can be dangerous if occassion arose. Also when I make a schedule and let certain apps be used at certain times, out of nowhere it will block things I did not have blocked.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The control interface is pretty basic, but is very badly done.  Some examples: // I disabled ""School Time"" to make an AM and PM school time to let him have some free time at lunch.  School time became invisible to me, but it still blocks him with ""School Time"".  Very difficult to debug. // I'm unable to create new schedules based on a template.  Back to the AM and PM example, we should be able to copy an existing schedule, or allow more than one contiguous time segment.  But you can't.  So you have to input everything manually. // Manual input for a custom schedule doesn't even work.  You spend your time manually clicking all the apps and then click save, you get a ""Settings saved"" green box, but nothing was saved.  Then you have to go back in and click just one app, then click save, then go back in, click save again , etc.  It's exhausting and horrible. // There is a save button on some of the screens for updating the apps, but not others.  The app doesn't stop you from leaving the screen without clicking the save button, so you lose all your work.  But this isn't such a big deal since it wouldn't save your work anyway. // Oh, and the ""chat with us"" support button doesn't work.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Loved it until discovered it had been uninstalled from child phone. which happened twice and parent phone had not been accessed to do so. What is the use of an app like this if the ones being watched can just take it off when they want? Waste of time and money. This was not recent but over a month ago and the other over six months ago. Extremely disappointed.,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great for intimidating recalcitrant behavior. Usually but not always reliable reporting. Better with Android than iOS devices. Home page report does not always reflect daily log time report. perhaps 3 5 stars.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Best app on the market. It's the only one that consistently works and gives me the control I've been searching for. It allows time constraints, time blocks (ie blocked while at school or overnight), app blocks, and so on. It's a great app and the only one that works. My kids have Amazon Fire tablets. The only issue is that one of the tablets is a new Fire HD 8, and the app doesn't work on the new versions. Customer service is aware and will be letting me know when this is fixed.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app helps a lot to control our sons obsessive nature with electronics.  He is learning when it is okay and not okay to be on his phone, which unfortunately is needed to be taught now-a-days.  However, we are still figuring it out too.  We just recently added other electronics that both our children use as well to avoid the night-time sneaking electronics to bed stunt.  We limit our children's use beyond this app which I think is needed as well.  I would like to see an ability to prevent certain apps/website even further as he has found ways to by-pass for instance u-tube;  he goes onto google and gets there instead of the app...but overall it is a well written app, no major issues with glitches yet.  I also felt the premium package was reasonably priced, however the new additional features would have been nice to be included in the price.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I like alot of the features and the ability to monitor and restrict activity. if I could make a recommendation I would request that the emergency call feature be made so that you can restrict who they are calling and not just be free reign.

With the app, she had to sit and talk with us about which of her screen uses needed to be restricted and which deserved anytime access.  Now she doesn't fight with us when she's hit the daily limit because she pays more attention to real time.  She's ""owning"" her own behavior around the phone, and accepting the limits because we agreed on them together.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,usefull,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Worked good for a couple months. Now the free time setting doesn't work and it randomly blocks Apps. I clicked on ""chat"" and now that doesn't work either.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The best thing out there to monitor their phones. If anything I like that I can block everything besides phone calls and music when she's grounded.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"im using this free version once it expires I will probably purchase the licence, I really love the app. I can control my daughter's screen time and motivate them with task. so helpful. one day she play smarter than the app. she deleted it from her ipad unknowingly the app once deleted. it will lock all her app and parent will received a message that my daughter's ipad has an issue. re installing can fix the issue. thanks",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"completely horrible app, it blocks so many functions of the phone and makes kids able to do virtually nothing. im not saying this for games, im saying this because most of their functions also turn off calling, texting, and even emergency calling! imagine if a teen was out late at night and needed to call the police, but all they saw was this app. if there was a zero rating i would give it, because this app is legitimately dangerous. I have many more complaints that i want to give but no space.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,keeps getting better and better. had helped us manage our kids' usage for years now. i recommend to all my friends routinely!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,NO U,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"it's a pretty good app. I like that you can pause the phone when you need to get their attention. it works well for making schedule for your child's phone usage. I would say that I wish it was a bit more detailed. telling me my daughter used her contacts and her phone calls isn't that helpful if I don't know who shes calling. there's no supervising who is added or talked to. recently my teen was talking to an adult and I didn't know. all I know is how often she uses apps. but all in all, its ok",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it!! Recommend it to all my momma friends!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,been using this since March 2016. last update has made the app useless for me. i can't control anything from my phone. going to ask for a refund for this year is they don't fix immediately. sent message yesterday and no response. app is running on pixel 2 with latest operating system so no excuses.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Bugging, on Samsung s10, when I try to give free play, it just says sending and never sends. Kids and I very frustrated!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"App works well. I would give it 5 stars if you could choose to always allow particular apps. It lets you always allow emergency phone calls, but I would like to be able to allow phone calls and text messaging. with this app, it's all blocked. You can block specific individual apps but not allow individual apps.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Been using it for 4 years. Well-designed and NEVER buggy. Worth every penny.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I like it. While I used Samsung. But after changed my phone and bought Huawei. It works for hour or two and then turns blocker off....And I can't do anything to prevent my child from watching YouTube.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Good app but it causes issues with my sons phone, it stops the phone working correctly. When I change setting on my phone, they won't appear on my sons phone until his phone is restarted. I pay for the app and I feel that it is not worth the money until they fix the fault.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"its been great. the only issue im having is when i updated to android 9.0, the freeplay function doesnt work anymore. please fix.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It used to work flawlessly but now sending free play does not work. really frustrating.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Paid for the subscription, but every time I try to modify settings, it takes a reboot of my child's phone to update. This is so annoying, that I am considering to cancel my subscription. This needs to be something that takes a few seconds, 60 seconds max. But I've been trying for 25 minutes to get my child's phone to accept that I've opened up free time. Eventually I had to reboot their phone to get it to happen. I don't want to use the pin code, since this requires me to be there in person. Really messed up, sorry. I tried to use both phones on cellular or WiFi, and today I even tried to do this when both are connected to the same WiFi. Nothing works other than reboot.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Worked great for well over a year until the last few weeks. Bed blocker which is the main need I have on Android does not work on two different devices. Working with tech support but they dont seem to have any answers. Sadly looking for an alternative.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,recent update looks to have broken task approvals and freetime modes. additional time isnt getting to childs device,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,used to be good. updates have been causing issues. needs attention. won't be updating my subscription.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,terrible,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,trust your children don't be a helicopter parent or else you really want to mess up your relationship with your child just to talk to them about with their doing instead of ruining your relationship with them just a suggestion you can ruin your relationship with your children all you want with all these locks but just a FYI,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,it's been great,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Well when it works it is good.  It just started changing all kinds of settings when I had my phone/web interface open and both phones sitting by my side.  So I know it was not the kid doing it.  Sometimes the emergency phone setting works for calls while the kid's phone is paused/locked sometimes it doesn't.  Total ghost in the machine and a waste of my money.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,LOVE this app! Keeps my kids motivated to do chores and homework with screen time instead of allowance. helps me manage them when I'm not home.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,awesome I wish it worked the same for apple products,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Kids hate it, but works good for me as a parent.. it's been a little extra buggy lately.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It does not work when parents on andriod phone and kids with iphone. it sorts all applocations when block period is done.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Having been a user for a couple of years I'm sad to say I'm not planning to renew in July. The app isn't working like it is supposed to and I'm continually having to uninstall, reinstall and re-pair my kids devices to get any kind of control. I'm being told by support of ongoing server backlog/speed issues but I expect much better from a paid for service. It's a great concept but perhaps a victim of it's early success and it's hardware now can't cope .",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have been unable to operate the custom time limits since the update. it needs fixing,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So very useful. I great way to control the kids technology time. I found they wanted to go on it less as they knew their days and limits. Although they were permitted to go on it daily it turned out they chose their time wisely and only went on it 3 out of the 7 days.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,very good,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,You cannot get ahold of anybody at this company. There is no phone number for them. I do not wanna do business with a ghost company. Right now trying to get a cancelation of service and can't get any response.,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,garbage.. doesn't work!!!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"For the last month screen time hasn't been working. The block list won't sync, and the command to pause rarely works. Support has been useless, telling me there are known issues with their service and a work around is to routinely uninstall and reinstall the kids app.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,it helps me know the apps my kids use,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works OK during the trial period but then you gotta pay. Then you gotta pay more for other options. Then when you decide you don't wanna pay for services that are free on other apps, you have to be a technical genius to uninstall. Please... I just want this off my phone. It's too heavy and it's slowing me down.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great App! Initially my child was angry and irritated by the App. Some children act as if you're torturing them & giving them a slow death, but they eventually calm down and see the benefits",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,They hate it! I am loving it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I really appreciate this app however, the link between my phone and my son's phone is frequently broken. is there any way to keep this from happening?",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works as advertised! We can actually get the kids to do their chores now! 😊,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,epic,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,tried location out and it never worked. app sometimes doesnt seem to work correctly on kids devices. pausing doesnt seem to go past midnight. should have extended pausing time for when they are grounded from devices.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great and allows me to feel comfortable with my child having a phone because I can control it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"this app has been easy to set up and use. my boys hate that I can easily control their phones from either my phone or my computer. this has made life easier. I love the the task feature, since my boys are goal oriented this function works very well for us.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Would be great if it was free!!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,family with 5 kids were becoming very reliable o n technology and screen time which was causing a lot of angst in our house so glad I found this app after 2 weeks my kids are tr3ating me with respect and we have eye contact conversations,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Life changing. My kids are even getting in to the task completion.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works not stable. Doesn't block new apps,3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,this is amazing!!! great to control mt daughter's phone restrictions. download one for hers and one for mine and synced perfect,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,A pretty great app overall. My teen hacked it once... but we've been good ever since a stern discussion (and long phone hiatus!). The support team was very helpful.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,update. started logging me out everytime i tried to use it. Got to be a real pain in the ass and even dangerous as one time my son could not use his phone to call us. unsubscribed and uninstalled. if you're not careful you can make usable features and safety features of your phone not work correctly.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Not worth buying. My kid is using mobile while I'm seing it's inactive,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,it works great on 1 of my kids devices but not on the other it keeps turning off app blocker on their device as well as daily limit and bedtime. tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it with no luck so frustrating. she was on it for 4 hrs and her daily limit is 1 1/2 plus i blocked you tube and she was on it as well,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works for some basic monitoring and limits. Performs well. Developers working on improving available features.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We installed this on both my kids devices. It's been great. For the first little bit my son hated it, lol. However, yesterday as we talked about some of the not so good stuff he'd been reading online he thanked me for blocking accesses to something he was having trouble staying away from. I love that I can set limits on how long and when. It takes some of the conflict out of screen use. being able to show them how they were spending their time is a great tool. Very easy to setup and use.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Initially rated this app 1 star coz I thought I was being forced into a premium version then realised premium version is what is offered for the free trial . Read the notes guys, don't be like me. Overall, good app. it has worked for us. I can monitor apps to be used at specific times and has allowed my daughter to keep off the phone without loosing it altogether. Can easily be uninstalled but I believe Screentime has come up with a solution. I am yet to test it.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Didn't even have on childs phone for a whole day before we had to uninstall because of constant issues. Does NOT work on iPhones like company claims!,1

I have went through and turned every single location permission on the app on and I still get a red warning saying location cannot be found.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I just don't understand the tasks,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app! Definatly gives me peace of mind and allows me to view everything my kids are doing. Love the option to earn screen time rewards through completing tasks as well as bed time and outdoor time turn off.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Like all programs of this type, setup is cumbersome. The app has lots of nice features (some of the for an extra charge), and customer support gets back pretty quickly. The big problem is that it does not work properly on all phones. My child has a Xiaomi phone, and the app sometimes doesn't know that she is on way past her allotted time. Even when it does know, it doesn't block her phone, and she can continue for hours after I receive a notification that she has maxed out. I can pause her phone manually, but that's not what I paid for.",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It used to work perfectly and I was ok paying for it every month. Now, it doesn't update with free time when I send it, it doesn't block apps and it's almost completely useless.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"When setting up the app, I could choose from a list what apps to restrict. After initial setup i am now unable to go back to the list of apps to make changes. Also, I left some apps unrestricted like phone and music. However, once the daily limit has been reached, only emergency calls are left unrestricted. So I guess it doesn't matter that the app list is unavailable. The app has some very nice features, but without the option to keep some functions unrestricted, it is not what i need.",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I am loving this app and have reccomended it to friends! My 13 year old isn't thrilled with the app, but I explaining to him the reason it is set up is because I love him & his brother and want them to be safe. I love that I can set times for bed time so no appliances get snuck in to the room since it is locked. 4 stars cuz I have a hard time unblocking an app when it's set up to be turned off. example: music app at bedtime, i can unblock but my boys still can't use it. other times it is fine",4

When they are at school you can pause the phone but they still have access to apps that you allow (I pause social media during school hours). It also keeps up with how much screen time they have which can be an eye opener.,5

No longer arguing with my kids! some improvements: #1 option to combine screentime or app usage limits across multiple devices for the same child. #2 If multiple devices are set per child, show remaining screentime at the top of the summary, not at the bottom of each device. It's annoying to glance at used time. #3 Let me turn off the geolocation promo! It's always expanded and takes up screen space Ps. There is no info about the cost of the geolocation feature.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,using screen time has made a radical change in our home for the better. our daughter who is 15 is no more engaged personally with family members as well as with things she used to do before she got a phone. we didn't give her a phone until she was 13 and up until now it's been fine but the use of time is creeped up. before I put in the limits on the phone I just collected how much time she was using the phone and on what apps before she and I figured out together what we wanted to do. we love it.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Do not waste your money using this app. My son did a simple Google search and figured out how to get around using the app. I went back and forth with this company and none of their suggestions worked.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Didn't need any convincing to purchase the full version. This app has made a huge difference in our lives.

Now I no longer worry - I know that once their time is up, it's up. I have configured the app so that my 11 year olds only have 10 minutes to start their day. Until they do a maths worksheet, they can then claim their allotted hour. Their maths has improved significantly! The kids resisted the app at the beginning, but they now understand that these are the rules and they now accept it. This app has honestly been fabulous for us. The kids are smarter for it, they are more helpful (by doing more chores) and I yell much less!! Thank you for such a fantastic product.",5

I love that I can see what he's spending his time on.  I love that I can motivate him to do certain things through the ""rewards"" portion of the app.  I love that it tells me anytime he downloads a new app, and that it automatically limits that app until I say othewise.  And I love that I can leave his phone ""on"" throughout most of the day, and can limit the apps I want - like, he is limited on his time on Social Medai, but he can have unlimted access (except for the bedtime schedule, or any other I add), to his music, or the functions he needs at at school.

My son's high school also uses this app on their iPads, which is great because the iPads are used for EVERYTHING, and it's nice to be able to use screen time to limit access to certain websites and limit daily gaming time.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,this app was recommended to me a year or so ago and at the time i didn't think that I needed it... until the suggestion was made to get my 10 year old son a phone. I was totally against it my I was overridden by the grandparents. I had started off with the trial and upgraded to the 6 month subscription. The bed time functionality is great. At first he didn't like it until I told him why I was I doing it and told him that I could add additional time if he finished his tasks. He really likes it.,5

I have had others before that were worthless and had crappy customer service, but so far, Screen Time has been pretty good.  My kids grumble about it and constantly think up new ways to trash-talk it, but they do understand what we have it. My wife and I have been able to integrate our apps and spend a limited amount of time re-setting or troubleshooting issues.  My wife did use customer service and they were quick AND helpful.  You really need to pay attention to the settings as they are the key to having things run smoothly.  As far as OS integration, it is what you would expect with Android and iOS... Android is good and detailed where iOS is minimal and hard to control.  iOS doesnt allow the level of app detail and counts ANY use as part of a time restriction... I havent figured out how to control that aspect.  I think this app is worth the money and deserves a higher rating than many of its competitors.  Time will tell on how this affects phone use in my house. Oh, and the daily reports are very useful.",5

You developers need to get your game on kids are figuring back doors to this app with ease. Believe me if mine can do it anyone can. I want my money back I paid for the whole year and its been 6 mo. and of the last 2 had been a nightmare 9/7/18 Worth every penny. The only thing that would make me love it more would be a browser filter for inappropriate sites. But no worries because I just blocked the browser all together.  I believe in responsibility and accountability giving my child the chance of ""earning"" the privilege of having a phone is the best feature of this app. And you kids giving this app bad reviews you are only proving that it works.

Can't trust the app as it drops out really often off (weekly?) from childs phone. Another childs Nexus 5X works fine. 2. Also huge lag when selecting limited apps from settings. When doing several settings in a row the lag reverses your new settings back to old. Work around is to do one setting at a time and wait for few seconds then next one etc.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,FANTASTIC app again now it's been fixed and the new features are great too web content blocking and the ability to allow the phone to work in emergency situations whilst the phone is in sleep mode is a good idea,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Android linking to Apple not so good. keeps blocking my son's iPad despite still got plenty of screen time. in the end have to install it. The lack of available blocker for Apple tablet and mobile means i have to find another way to control access time for my kid.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app provides real time control. I am able to change the parameters as needed. I have full control over what apps my son can download. I can see how long he uses each function on his tablet and his peak times of use. I am very happy with my purchase! ***we have used screentime for over 4 years now and we still love it (our kids still hate it)! ***my son was able to delete the kids version off his phone by doing a factory reset. I caught him because of the daily usage email!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app gives me the opportunity to remotely control my daughter's device usage, but what's more, it's a valuable tool for us to use together to both see how she's spending time on her device.

I've told mine, for example, that it's sort of like training wheels; annoying but good for getting used to being safe and smart.",5

I also would like to have where free play can be adjusted by location instead of having to switch it over ALL the time. my kids play their tablet in the car and I dont believe it should go against their daily limit. I wish if we left a certain location like our home it would automatically turn free play on!,3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,this app is good for limiting actual time on phone but not good for keeping track of the apps being used or content being viewed. also this app is very prone to glitches. I'm not a huge fan. stopped using it long ago.,2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I adore this app. I can see everything that is happening with my children. I can set parameters so they don't turn into mindless phone robots.

PROS kids don't argue with the device when it's time to turn off. Different ways to block/limit/allow different apps at different times/days. CONS install instructions should tell you how to install so that kids can't uninstall it. had to uninstall and reinstall with some updates (which isn't easy) and it would be good to pool multiple devices to one kids limits/settings.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,my husband and I love it. it makes monitoring and reward our kids for chores so much easier. the app does the dirty work for us by kicking them off the tablet at bed time. when we first installed the app everything worked great.

Not having to physically touch her device to have complete control from mine is fantastic and the selling point for me.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,this is a very useful tool to have. you have control of the time you set for use of devices and kept informed of any apps installed. you can also use a block function to stop children installing new apps or paying for things. highly recommended.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Really helos us manage the boys screenshots time and keeps them with in their limits.Great app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It is a bit tricky to use with IOS, but it does limit the usage of the phones for both the kids. Much easier to use with android OS.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,app is exactly what i needed. only thing missing is messaging between parent and child devices. it only has a option for a note to send with the task or free time but . it would be alot better with remote messaging.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app for monitoring screen time. It's a must have for parents with children who use electronics!!!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"best decision to install screen time. No arguments, kids choose to spend less time spent on devices, jobs / homework done before they even ask to use devices. Love the parental controls as you can block apps that arent suitable.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Such a great app! prefect for keeping a time limit on devices. Love love love the task section! My kids have to get their chores done before they can request more time!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I wish I had found this app sooner!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best App to keep the kids motivated,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is a game changer for our teenagers and there phone's.We love being able to see what they are using,when, for how long and having a say in all those things.You approve or deny every app they download.My only gripes are that ALL the features should be available to you once you pay.I don't want to have to pay extra for the internet monitoring.Also there are times you approve or set something and it just doesn't ""stick"" so you have to re do it.Those minor things side we use this everyday.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,very difficult to use and not enough info on how to use it.👎,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. I felt like before for each device my kids had it was like having an additional kid. now with this app I have monitoring and limits that are set and no longer have to worry about sneaking apps or devices. So very grateful.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Perfect for every over controlling helicopter parent. If you want your kids to hate you and deteriate your relationship with them, I suggest you install this app. I find this app is popular with older parents that do not understand the internet, as a relatively young 30 year old parent, I highly advise against using this app. An app isn't going to solve issues you have with your kids.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Does exactly what it says. Gives me the ability to view my child's device activity plus control it remotely. With so many bad reviews from kids, you know it must work! LOL",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Has several little UI bugs and inconsistencies, doesn't behave/integrate well on iPad or when the wifi network access is controlled on router side, and few obvious enormous design flaws (total allowed time is per-device  this is really stupid). Apart from this, allows parent to get elements of control and counter-balance addictive scenarii kindly introduced by gaming and anime industries for the sake of children's and families'.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The parental app seems to work just fine. I haven't had any problems with the parental version. However, the trouble seems to be with the child version of the app, which just does not work consistently. And unfortunately, if the child version doesn't work right it defeats the whole point of a parental controls app. I'm really disappointed, that this set of apps just does not work like it should.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,so far i like it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Could be more granular with per day and time scheduling for bed time and school time. If a calendar could somehow be integrated it would be outsranding.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,only a white screen,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great for Android but iPhone is another story. Always blocks iPhone and stops working correctly.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is an update to my original rating...moved from 3 stars to 5. I updated to the paid version and use it to manage devices for two children. Since both parents can manage the kids' accounts, it makes it easy to monitor usage when the kids go between homes. Well worth the cost to ensure that my kids are safe!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,the kid found how to bypass the limits by. there's a bug which gives a few seconds delay between launching an app and getting the prevention screen.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So far so good. It locks down my daughters tablet after an hour. It doesn't work right with multiple accounts. I have my daughter set up with a restricted account.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,once you learn how to use it this app is awesome it does exactly what it needs to do and when it needs to do it if I could I would give at 8 Stars just an upper front warning it's really going to take off your kids but know that when it does it's because it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,love the options and the daily summaries. sometimes it has a hard time updating which makes it frustrating to have accurate times.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Useful app. I used to use it whem my son was little and my daughter now asked me to install it to help her cut down on phone use. It's a bit more complicated than it used to be but still excellent.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,a very useful tool for controlling your kids screen time. of course the kids will give out bad reviews for it!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app to ensure your child is safe, would like to see it available on other phones like windows",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"i love this app. it gives me control of my sons screen time, allows me to monitor his web site usage and locate him. i have been looking for an app to do this. it doesn't make him feel like i am invading privacy because he doesn't know i see all and get reports. he gets annoyed because it shuts down phone when his time is up and at bedtime. the only other thing that is slightly annoying is the app wants to update,  but i have his settings blocked (he found a way to disable unless I blocked his settings) so the app can't update because it needs access to settings. minor annoyance on my end, but major annoyance on his end. still, it's the best option i have found. also, the customer service is great and they respond quickly. kudos.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very useful for parents. Thanks a lot.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My child was able to disable the device admin permissions via the settings (while paused) in less than 60 seconds.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We love being able to control device time for our kids without having to think about it too much. The mobile app is really nice.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have this app for my kid and every time I want him to have free play it is still locked I hate the app 😡😡,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Ive tried 4 different screen timing apps and this is by far the best. I have a 6 and 9 year old and they also rate this one as being superior, for example they like being able to check in and see how much time is left (wierdly lacking on many other apps). I like the fact i can choose some apps to be excluded from the time limit - ie spellings and that i can easily stop or overide the time limit without a long logging in proceedure on their ipads. Definitely recommend!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it! I can see what my kids are playing and for how long. Also set limits and add tasks that must be completed before their tablets are available for use again.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it. Simple and flexible,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,couldn't not ask for a better app and control what my son can do and when on his tablet and even what apps he gose on as some at night can make him hyper.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It works poorly, using a yearly paid subscription.    For the most part, it is unusable in iPad (and presumably in all iOS devices for that sake). The support guys recognize that instantly when you ask for a number of troubles in iPad control, they of course say is due to iOS limitations and such, but the truth is they sell the product as if can work in Android and iOS. Well, don't buy this if you plan to use it with iOS. Regarding Android, it partially works. Problems we found which make it a pain to use: * It ignores ""free time"" in most cases. You assign 30min free time to your kid but the kid never gets that, even if restart the blocked application, etc. * There is no way to ""block"" the full phone anytime. So you select apps which can be used at certain time ranges in the day, and that is all. If you all of sudden wants to fully block all apps, there is no such option. If you want your kid to force answering the phone and stop playing or whatever, there is no such option. I would suggest to look for some other better app.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does not work as intended. My children were able to uninstall and the interface has inaccurate and outdated info compared to my child's device. Waste of money.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"difficult to use. Sloppy and haphazard. Key information, directions and instructions are frequently omitted. For example, I set up a new schedule for my child from 8am to 8pm, and checked Apps to be blocked. But are the Apps blocked WITHIN that time frame, or OUTSIDE of that time frame?? I actually want to block App access after 8pm, but it doesn't allow me to do that using a schedule. Go figure? I've encountered a dozen haphazard items like this since I started using the app.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,love this app even though I don't have children I use it for double lock screen,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,works perfectly,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This has been the best app for our tablets so far. I have been using it for a month. I like the task features and I love the control . I don't like that I can't use it freely on all the devices that they use so they avoid the devices with screen time on them. I also wish I could deduct time from my original time I gave for the day.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,good,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's been an extremely valuable tool to have to help us limit and monitor our children's screen time.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The app is excellent and works as advertised.  A must for parents who love their kids and wants to protect them from an excess of screen usage. An app Parents will love and kids may loathe because it works so well. You can easily turn the kids phones off at bed time. Limit usage during school and homework hours. You can use the app to reward with extra screen time when the kids complete tasks or show good behavior. It's easy to lock down content you want to avoid and open the phone when they need it.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"In addition to not working properly and not reporting and losing connection to the child's device which review of mine I don't see now on this page, they have now taken the liberty to cancel my subscription without my authorization. Once I was left without subscription, the child's device immediately became viisble again, i. e. I was able to see what the child was doing although could not block anything without subscription. Nevermind, lost connection again. Too bad, was a good idea otherwise.",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a sufficient app for my needs. I wish there was a tad more customization and I wish the menus were a bit easier to navigate but its an otherwise decent app. I would like more details on the web monitoring service, but I dont want to sign up for the trial before Im ready for it. Also, because it's a trial, that tells me it's a paid add on...not a fan of that logic or business strategy. I'll likely look for something else more comprehensive after my subscription is over.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"rubbish, had for a year and deleted it before espire. Doesn't block apps, unreliable, crash all the time and all that customer service does is copy and paste answers back to you when you ask for solutions. Not worth the headache and troubles!!!",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've evaluated several similar apps, and this is the only one that allows schedule and time limitations on android for particular apps without disabling the whole phone. It does exactly what I need it to do. Reasonable price, user-friendly interface, and a generous free trial period. The only negative is that the child app can be uninstalled unless you use a special web-installation method. Another app I evaluated password protects the uninstall process. Please consider adding this feature.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best app for monitoring a young child's usage as they progress into using a tablet. Tracking all apps and filtering out the things parents don't want their child to access also very good. Comprehensive reports and good flexibility . Price for premium is decent. would recommend this to anyone.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Couldn't be happier with this app.  Have recommended to several people already.  My son now accepts that it is a condition of having devices, but that's after his failed hacking attempts - which screentime notified me about and locked up his phone.  I use it as incentive to help around the house and to keep him focused on homework.  He has ADHD and needs to listen to music while doing homework and this app allowed me to choose app by app what I wanted to block.  I also use Disney Circle.  I like Screentime much better.  If Screentime had a PC version, I would ditch the Circle.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I hate this little it just annoyed me by when I'm on a very important thing like doing a long test thing on robloxs then it blocks me the whole screen and forgot to save it and my whole hard work for 3 weeks was gone but I have some snapshots so I might see all of the stuff and rebuild it again I'm still building the work again but now I'm half way and I'll have to save the work 5 minutes before my free time ends.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,i enjoyed the app and was easy to use. schedules and bed blocker and app blocker were easy to use and i could allow the apps i deemed permissable for her to use,5

It only seems to work at home, I get notifications for everything until we leave the house, then nothing, even though my son has been playing on his phone with data and/or WiFi, no updates for hours!

But I have now put google family link on my daughters new tablet (to turn on google safe search) and it no longer works correctly.    To uninstall family link I have to delete my daughters google account - :(,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Pros: This app is awesome, my house has never been cleaner!  Man, do my kids hate this app with a fiery passion, there is nothing quite like seeing the horror in their eyes as their daily allotment of minutes trickles down to zero, then watching them scramble to do as many chores as they can to earn some extra minutes. It's like watching a crack addict hustle to get their next fix.   I'd never thought I'd see the day when an 11 and 9 yr old are fighting to see who gets to take out the garbage just to earn 10 minutes of time!  Screen Time Labs support is pretty quick to respond to issues.  Cons: • The app doesn't work with other MDM solutions, you can only have one or the other and this isn't a complete MDM solution. • Apple support really kinda sucks. Kids can delete the MDM profile without being prompted for a password or PIN. You will get prompted when they do that however. • The push Free Time to devices is wonky on occasion, sometimes it works right away, sometimes it doesn't. • Doesn't work on Chromebook, PC's, or gaming consoles (yet at least).  TL/DR: House is clean, kids hate it, I'm happy.",5

It ends arguments begging to use their devices, as well as sneaking to play since it shuts it down when time is up. I can control it all from my phone, even when I'm not home. It protects kids from messing with my apps and erasing my lists, etc. because I can block that app from them. I love it!",5

Well worth the money. It cuts down on distractions during the day.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is a great help. Parents' lives get so busy automating the task of limiting screen time is the right thing to do. It also gives kids a real sense of how much time they spend on their phones and tablets and they begin to budget the time on their own. For 5 stars I have two wishes. (1) set a ""global"" limit on all devices under one name. Right now my kid gets 2h max per day, but with access to two devices it becomes 4h! (2) I'd love a ChromeOS version.",4

Old review: I've tried other parental control apps and this one is by far the only app that's simple to use and it's actually in real-time, no delay in blocking the app when my son tries to open an app after he's used his allocated time. It has even motivated my son to actually do chores to get more screen time.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Parents, a couple of caveats you should be aware of with this app.    1. If your child uses a Samsung phone on the Sprint network, he/she can start the phone in ""Safe Mode"" and completely bypass the controls in the app.  Screen Time support suggested setting up a SIM card PIN, which is supposed to require a PIN to enter ""Safe Mode"".  After multiple phone calls with Sprint and Samsung, there does not appear to be a way to set a SIM card PIN for Samsung phones on Sprint. I believe this is a Sprint issue as other carriers appear to make this option available for Samsung phones.  A clue here is if you know your kid was using the phone, but no activity shows up in the Screen Time history.  2. I'm not sure if this is just another Sprint/Samsung issue or if it affects all phones and carriers, but but the app doesn't block anything for the first 30 seconds or so after turning on the phone.  Free access to any site/app for 30 seconds before the app begins to block.  In both of these circumstances, the activity does not show up on the app.    I suggest checking your kid's phone activity on the phone itself, even if you don't suspect any misuse.  Otherwise you'll never know.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,You will love it!  Your kids wil hate it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app came up as free. The only thing free is to install and sync. You can't block anything unless you get premium. You can't set limits unless you get premium. Useless unless you pay for it.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The app is good but misleading it's touted as free but after you install set it up and go looking (you have to really look) you find out Its a a trial 14 days only then All the features you want it for are gone. I hate apps that do this and will be removing it without even finishing the trial they don't tell you about the trial in the description they mus lead you saying you get great free features but can go premium for better that's a lie DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME if you want to pay $6 a month buy a more trusted service like Norton etc..,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's awesome,5

Clicking that took me to another page with a couple of answers. These truncated after 3 lines and advised I watch the video. However tapping the text didn't give the rest of the paragraph or link me to the video. What video? A truly awful user experience trying to set up the software. I gave up and uninstalled it.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is amazing! We used the trial, and it's incredible how much a few minutes of screen time works to give our son incentive to help out around the house more. Even after the trial had ended - he *still* continued the daily routine he had gotten into with his various chores.  We still wound up purchasing a subscription for this, because the premium features seemed well worth the price.  My only reason for not rating this 5 stars is because it's not (natively) available on Android TV. Our son has a shield in his room, and it would be AMAZING to be able to lock down this device as we did his tablet.  Please consider Android TV support! For now, I'll try sideloading it. :D",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app updated today, haven't been able to open it since. All I get is a flash and crash.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is the best I've seen in the parent-oversight line of apps.  It gives really great granular detail about when your child uses an app, and for how long.  The daily email updates are fantastic, especially since my kids live in a split home environment and so all parents interested can stay informed no matter where they're at.  The app is not perfect by any stretch, but its the best I've found so far for keeping tabs on what my kids are doing on their phones and for how long.  I'm not sure what other reviewers mean by there being too many ways to ""work around"" it.  If your child is actively trying to manipulate the system, there are ways to discern this.  But if you have a child that is purposefully trying to get around oversight like this, there is always a way no matter what method or app you use.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Initially I thought this app was great. My son switched to iPhone and I can no longer track anything on his phone. It also locks up my sons phone regularly. The location option very rarely works. I am now looking for a new app as this one has too many defects to make it worthwhile to pay a subscription that doesn't work as advertised.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love it. You can read all of your spouses texts and see all his call logs. Even during the 7day free trial period. However you can not read messenger messages or deleted messages. And it keeps giving.me.the wrong location.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I am locked out and the program fails to accept the password reset despite multiple attempts. No way to access help since I can't get into the app. Very poorly designed and administered.,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent although my 13 year old son did find a way round it!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Just recently figured out why my kid can still watch YouTube while it and browsers are blocked: although screentime app is also blocked, it is still possible to get to screentime help Web page. From there whole Internet is reachable without any problems. It is only visible in web history monitor, though. At the moment it works on one phone though. Connecting/reconnecting the second kid's phone does work for the first 10 minutes, after that it just stops. Very very very annoying! :( Keeping this app only because it somehow works fine on one kid's phone.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app to keep track of time used on a device. We recommend 😊,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Simply does not work. I set the time for 1.5 hours but it allows my daughters to go 3 hours. I reset it every day but it doesn't matter. I've contacted customer service but they have been unable to fix it. Going to have to switch to a different app.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The idea of the application is good, but my son manages to disable the kids application on many occasions, even though it was installed directly from the site as instructed. We've tried Google's family link, and looks to be better integrated with the device management features of Android (not to mention it's free...). Another hasstle is that every time I open the parents app Ineed to login again, and then it takes long rime until the usage is updated.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Supposingly child-proof, yet can easily be uninstalled by the child itself, by simply going to Settings/General/Apps/Screentime",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have used Screen Time for both of my children on all of their devices for the past two years. I like the options to set individual times for each child. I recommend this app to any parent wanting to manage online activity.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good one. Helps regulate kids screen time on different devices without taking there device in hands. But the bad things is kids can delete it from their devices,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,A nice app but it has one problem. It did not record my child's time accurately and made his apps crash or be blocked when he was given screen time. Nice but flawed.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's a very good and simple app to use i would recommend this in every family with kids. Even our own kids love it. They still find every open app. No problem it's all under control. Thanks for this app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Doesn't work properly. Doesn't tell you which apps are being used. Geolocation doesn't work. Won't let you pick select apps to restrict.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome app. Always willing to help and take feedback on the app. It is great,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I'm a paying customer but the app itself is terrible in terms of using the parental controll app.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It simply does not work on Android.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I like it but could use parent control on web. I would like it to specify certain websites I can block on the web instead of blocking the whole web. Update: If we pay for the screentime why do we have to pay extra for things that's included in the app? It's like us as parents are paying for another cable bill or a cell phone bill.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I couldn't tell what was free and what cost money. It froze up my son's phone and rearranged all his apps. It was difficult to uninstall. I must say, in fairness, I didn't spend a lot of time figuring out. I thought it would be more intuitive.",1

Sucks that I pay for a subscription that doesn't even work anymore.",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Perfect, right to the point and pretty customisable app. I tried Kaspersky Safe kids as it was half the cost of this but that app was terrible. If you r looking to restrict screen time for kids or schedule when they can use they're devices, this app is perfect. Just a lil pricey!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Sometimes this app is amazing. Sometimes it's not. But over all I recommend it to have control over your children's devices,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The app works great but I have learned that if the child does not close out the app before the time I have set to lock it she can still play just that game. I wish it was once the lock time hits that it locks the device and all apps whether shes still playing on it or not.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Definitely well worth having. Worth every penny.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is awesome...I use it for all 4 kids. If there is a bad reviews it's from kids not being able to do ANYTHING and everything ANYTIME they want on their tablets. Puts parents back in control of their kids content,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app was working great, then all of a sudden some of the features are not working after I joined the monthly subscription. I am not able to see her history, under the child's profile just keeps loading like it wants to add a picture, many other things.",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Update: once the kids figure they can still acfivate guest mode via the dashboard pulldown the app is defeated. They then can use Youtube and chrome in guest mode as much as they want. Until this is solved I'm dropping my rating to 2 stars. excellent app for keeping a lid on kids device usage. The user experience could use a tick more polish and feels clunky at first but the value add is YUUGE so this gets five stars.,2

Unfortunately, and this is why I give it only 2 star rating - the implementation is ridiculously full of bugs. From UI that doesn't show the real figures (limits en-vivo), settings such as 'limit by default' which are not applied, to other bugs which I'll avoid from detailing here, Oh so many of them that they provide my kids a perfect excuse for resisting entering this app into their lives. I just hope they resolve those bugs soon.",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"If you are a parent with a child or children with tablets, you will absolutely love this app. I am still getting used to it, but it has simplified greatly how I am able to control my son's tablet viewing. I definitely love some of the reviews on here , that obviously have come from the disgruntled children. Thanks for a great app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My family loves this app most of the time. It works well with our Android tablets, less so with the kindle fire. My kids know they can request more time or for apps to be opened. But also know that bed time is bedtime and that I get a daily report of their activities.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does exactly what it says it will.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"On this app for almost 1 year. Sometimes it doesn't work especially on the pausing function. When 'pause' is enabled, the child's device is still able to access. It also enables the kids to disable the function from its phone, not via the screen time app because it's controlled by password. But via the phone's own setting. Ios user can even delete the app which android is not able to. I have 1 android and 1 ios user. Once it's delete I have no means to track. Would have given it another star if is able to work on ios devices as much as android. Our pact doesn't charge for location services but now with the new introduction of the geolocation, I need to come out $$ for it. Pls consider giving it for free to those who has already on monthly subscription.",3

It frequently keeps my kid's phones paused when I have unpaused them. Some apps are completely excluded from the list & therefore have no limits set, and my kids somehow manage to use over their time limits anyway. It logs me off very often & I have to manually go in & reset each of my kids phones when it glitches. Not worth the hassle, gonna find another similar app.",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This works great! It's easy to remotely turn on/off their screen time from my own phone.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is terrible it made my family problems worse and it blocks things kids need like being able to call in a emergency.Emergencys happen all the time what if a kid was coming home with there parents at night and they get into a car accident and there parents are unconscious and the kids scared and they can't call for help or get out of the car that happens to people so much.It might not happen to u but still that's serious.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Bad,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's the best I get homework finished in time I love it every kid needs this app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Screen Time is excellent and I recommend it. I think time allocations should be settable daily rather than Monday to Friday and Saturday and Sunday.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good.,4

NOW both kids phones are connected but apparently none of the controls for me actually work since my son was on his phone at midnight last night. I am done with this stupid app.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We have used this app free & paid version for over 2 years on Android & iOS. It has allowed us to give our son freedom whilst being able to stay in control. Would recommend it to everyone.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Well worth the money. Helps me keep up with the content my kids are looking at on a daily basis. App blocker part is the best!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app locked my childs phone down while setting other things up . That the phone has no connection to the data on it . No way to remove it from the childs phone through using the parents side .,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Paid to use this app. Was great at first, but now it does not work consistently. The set limits are not working most of the time. Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling the app, only to have it stop working again a few days later. Don't waste your money.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Garbage,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It said it was free. The app is free but the continued use of the app is only for 14 days. However, I will pay the fee as this app has caused my child to want to do things to earn more time. It really is great.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Excellent! Now my daughter just has to sleep during night hours. Just experimenting with tasks, but looks like a GREAT idea - my daughter spent all her time on the device, and then started looking for a ""back door"" in the application. Found a 30 minute reward for cleaning her room, did it immediately, and took a picture of it. Then she saw 15 minute reward for ""tidy your room"", and claimed that one too...so she outsmarted the system, in a way.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Overall ok. But disappointed that my kids figured out how to uninstall it. I mean, what's the point of paying for its security if the kid can uninstall it?? Seems very backwards. I've been told there's a special version you can download from their website that's not available in the store... but that's how viruses and spyware get into your devices: by side loading software that is not in the store. This needs to be fixed.",3

Paid for a full year to quickly. I'm sure there is a way better one out there. Does not monitor other app usage, so there is no way to see which apps your child is using and how much time is spent using each app. Also no way to block different apps from being used at sertiant times. It's either block or unblocked as a group. And forget about paying extra for the GPS tracking. I used the free week and it was always 2 hours old. My sons tablet is on cellular when not on wifi.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app gay,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It sucks,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Sadly after paying so much the app came to an end due to the update every other month without informing and ended up my children are still happily playing with their phone.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app. This app has saved my daughter from a few inappropriate situations online so far by keeping me alerted to anything that looks or sounds suspicious and then allowing me to counteract! It also allows me to help keep my daughter interested in other things in life by letting set time limits. Would definitely recommend this app for any parents out there that could use the extra help with a defiant child!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I think this app is worth every penny I pay for it. We use every feature offered. My only suggestion would be to make every aspect of the app customizable rather than having to set up daily use and then separate schedules, then a bed blocker. Just combine them all into 1.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app started off great. I was managing my 3 kids iPads. My wife, sitters, and I could easily manage the tablets. We could manage this for iOS from Andriod and iOS devices.Over the last couple months however, the app became very unstable. The problem got worse week by week until it was finally unusable. The would often not track use time. The biggest problem was that the app would ""crash"" removing access apps. This would happen in the middle of games. Also the VPN connection would often stop connecting and would break internet access. This would crash games and sometimes Sceentime. Sometimes switching network connections would fix it. Sometimes disabling the VPN would fix it. Sometimes a reboot would it. Other times I had to fully uninstall and reinstall screentime. Finally today I removed Screentime. It was causing problems and frustration for my kids that was just not worth the features it offers. I have been in contact with support many times over this issue. While responsive, the were not able to help beyond basic steps and blamed rhe problems on my network or the kids killing the app in the background. Neither were true. Their reinstall instructions are also completely lacking and not helpful. Luckily I am an IT professional that specializes in mobile device management and I was able to troubleshoot and resolve issues on my own. iOS 12 now has a built in Screentime feature that can do most of what this app does. Andriod has had these features available for a while through Family Link. Use either of those over this app.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I loved it at first. I was so excited about to be able to reward my kiddos with tablet time for completing tasks, and block tablet time during certain hours. These attributes are helpful for a busy family, concerned with limiting screen time and keeping their kids safe. This app would spaz out and randomly take app access away in the middle of an activity. This would happen several times a session. The app also wouldn't track the time correctly, resulting in unlimited time. It got to the point that our kids tablets were useless except for taking pictures. My husband, who is in IT has contacted the developers multiple times to try to resolve the situation but the issues have actually worsened. Yesterday, we removed screen time app from our devices. It caused nothing but frustration and more work for us. I guess our kids were kept safe because they had such choppy access to their apps. I do not recommend this product.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Paid for use of this app, but it continually just stops working on my kids tablets and has to be uninstalled/reinstalled. Today I am totally locked out and have had to uninstall it completely from my kids tablets in order for them to use it. For the price, I expect it to work. Extemely unimpressed with this app.",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Terrible. This app messed up my phone, my daughter's phone and my sister's phone. Wrote to customer service and got no reply. Tells me my password is wrong to log into the app, go to the webpage it tells me my email address is wrong. The same email address you guys send 20 emails a day too.. terrible, DO NOT use this app.",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"After going through the painful process of setting up all the authorizations and permissions necessary for the app to run on my Huawei tablet, I found that it wasn't monitoring anything.  After some analysis I found that the app wasn't starting up at boot, so my tablet was being left unmonitored at every reboot.  For how much I searched and tried, I didn't found a way of fixing this problem. Hence I'm now switching to something else.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The only reason im giving a 4 star review is because if you limit youtube and not google and your child uses up all of their time it syays your child cant use google because your child cant use youtube anymore so please fix this,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,App works ok at best. Absolutely no blocking of inappropriate web content. Son easily overrides it. Being able to track activity is nice.... based on effectiveness of product it pry should be free I never was mad about the website addressing that. Apparently I have to log in 5x to leave a bad review. . I knew from the get go it wouldn't lock down websites. Thanks for your ineffectual comment Red Foreman... SON EASILY OVERRIDES IT. SHOULD BE FREE. DO NOT PAY. But thanks for your stupid comment. Caveat emptor,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Overall, I love the app. It allows me to set limits with my 12 year old daughter. If she wants more time, she had to earn it. If she isn't doing what she should be doing, I can instantly shut her apps down. My only disappointment is that I have an Android and my daughter has an iPhone, her iPhone blocks me from seeing what apps and sites she visits. If she had an Android, I would have more visabilty. I hope Apple agrees to give us visabilty at some point.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Recently the app stopped working for the device of my child. The App Log doesnt work anymore. The app simply stopped working, even after a reinstall using ScreenTime Guard.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Kids can disable the controls if they're fast since the app goes over whatever they're trying to access. Takes about a minute to disable. YouTube shows just how to do it. Very disappointed,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I was happy with the app at 1st period during the trial it worked OK. However, the app cost is outrageous. $40 a year is a lot when I am paying for other apps and things for the kids. Then it just stopped working at all when I didn't pay for it immediately",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Most of the features on the app do not work the scheduling does not work the Bedtime does not work and most of the time to pause and unpause does not work when you do positive it will stop your child's device but to reactivate it you have to go to your child's device clear all settings and then reinstall the app or it will hide all of their child's apps and will not bring them back on until it's unlocked very inconvenient,1

I check and they are updated through the app. I have had problems with the geotracking that they FORCED you to put the location on the device or you could not even use device,bed time (blocking apps that were not suppose to), and the daily time limit not even working(my current problem) for me PAYING every month you would think it would work right. currently looking for another app",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Having talked to other parents with children of my daughter's age, it becomes apparent that not many kid are able to control their use of the internet.  Be it games or videos, there is no reasoning that maybe ""I'm spending too much time and bandwidth on this device"".  It doesn't make them bad children, but it is part of being a responsible parent to regulate that time to other activities.  Yes, some will not appreciate what you are having to do. But you should spent time before explaining why this needs to be done beforehand and be reasonable on the settings at first.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"£3.99 a month seems a small price to pay for the knowledge that my daughter cant have her phone on past 10pm, except apps which i choose, and I can see what she is downloading and using from a distance. Totally worth it for peace of mind",5

It signs me out alot them I try to login in it will tell me there is no account with my email so I try to make a new accout and it tells me my email is already being used..

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have used the app for nearly an year now premium subscription. Unfortunately the all keep having problems: - devices keep de-synching. I've had a couple of bad discussion with the teenager as I thought he had guessed the password but finally I saw the app having the setting set up by me, lost a couple days later. The phone being locked in a drawer at my office. I'm talking about schedule and permissions. The very core features. - web and search history just don't work. We're talking of a Nokia 8, not a 20£ Android phone. - the app should show also the current activity on the child's phone but even with their phone in my hand and using it, my parent app site the phone not being used. - the app also require that you first setup a main user for the phone and then a secondary user for your child. If you don't do that the kids can easily create additional users and bypass the app. - they have recently introduced a GPS positioning but you're to pay additional 3£ per month. As a developer this is a pure scam as the resource needed to ping the GPS on a device already controlled by their app is no different by any other actions their app can already do. Avoid this app. You can only barely monitor your kids activity and can already do that reliably on the Google My Device.",1

Picked it as although it gives a limit, it gives the kids an element of control of when they use their time. I have found although we set a higher limit of time, they have picked up their phone far less and rarely use their full limit. I also like it allows certain apps to be unlimited so if they go out, they can still ring or text. Only issue is, it does not pick up times when data is turned off or not connected to wifi, so we have had to be mindful of that with times.",4

Customer support doesn't really know the cause for the problems, to be honest.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app the only thing that would make it better is if you could set different bedtimes for the weekend instead of the bedtime being the same for the weekdays and weekends other than that I love how u can set up tasks to earn phone time cause I would fight with my kids every day all day to do chores and help out around the house and now that they can earn extra time for doing things they help ALL the time and even ask if there's anything else besides what I have put on their task list that they can do.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has really helped manage screen time for my kids. I like that they can earn extra time by doing allotted tasks that the parent sets up. There is a weekend vs weekday option. I hope that they might break the weekdays out individually in the future. Another thing I would like to see might be a per app timer. My kids watch a lot of kids youtube.. And I would like to nudge that back to doing other things on their tablets. A overall good program.. Try it before yoy buy it.. You wont be sorry! In addition I would love if they had something a UK similar that could go on Nintendo DS. . That would be stellar to control all devices with 1 app.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Screen time is a great way to limit the time your kids spend on devices. I like that you can give them free time or extra time for doing tasks. I also like that you can set it up for multiple children on multiple devices. You can see what apps your child is using and what they download. Set up was easy and worked straight away. My kids moaned for a day or two and then it became the norm. There are a few places where it can improve. 1. The app works great on Android but is glitchy on my iPhone. 2. You can limit the time on each device, but not the total amount of time for all devices. For example, you can limit time on the phone to 30 min and on the tablet for 30 min, but not an overall time of 60 min that can be used in any manner they choose. 3. When you grant free time or approve a task, the clock starts when you approve rather than when your child turns on the device. So, e.g., if you grant 30 min free time or approve a task a 30 min, if your child in not using the device then they may miss out on the time. If they turn it on 30 min later they will have missed out entirely.",5

course simply block time if the need arises. I think the app is overall 
easy to use but I'd like the feature to globally allow an app (eg the phone

Contacted the developer who said ""well, we understand if this is a deal breaker ..."". Yes, it is most definitely a deal breaker when there is a big wide open door to the content that you were supposedly blocking. It does no good to block ""Chrome"" if the Google app is wide open and ready to use.

earned so they can't play all night despite the bedtime blocker! We've had 
to take a scary hard stance. I've told them if I discover a tablet in safe 
mode it will be sold or destroyed. Because they can still go to any site 
and access YouTube unobserved when in safe mode. Totally getting rid of the 
device may sound harsh, but only if you plan on breaking the rules. There 
are too many ways my children have managed to secretly bypass the 
protection of the parental controls. It takes more than an app to protect

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Tech Savvy Parent review... Bugs and gaps in control will let your child 
bypass restrictions. For example, You cannot block Google Assistant. Google 
assistant has limitless access to games, videos, and communication options. 
You have to constantly audit and check to see if your children are going 
around the app. 1) This app does NOT block screen saver games OR background 
games. Many parents had no idea that there are thousands of sceen saver 
games and background games. 2) The app and website are not using 
professional level coding and this will cause refresh errors to unblock 
items when you didn't intend to if you make two selections within 5 
seconds. Ten years ago coders switched to AJAX and object oriented 
programming to prevent this from happening. 3) An unknown bug will cause 
apps to automatically unblock themselves about 30 seconds after installing. 
My kid was nice enough to let me know when it happened. However, he could 
have just as easily exploited the bug. This meant I had to audit the app 
restrictions daily to fix it. With the coding bug on the app and website, 
it became annoying real fast. I found the only longer term fix was to 
delete the app and the child profile completely. I recreated the profile 
and reinstalled the app and it is working again. 4) Some apps never get 
recognized for restrictions. Occasionally my kid will install an app and it 
will show up on the log but not on the list of installed apps. Basically no 
ability to restrict it at all. The only way to know is if your kid tells 
you or you check the log daily.",2

for the very responsive customer service. You guys rock! 😊 Update: We went 
on holiday with friends for a month. On our last day, their 7yo son asked

and ""we are working on fixing this issue and will let you know when it's 
fixed"" messages. I reported a bug in one of their auxiliary features (auth 
via Facebook) was given this ""we're working on it""answer in mid-May, waited 
a month, complained again, and was told of a straightforward fix. I wish 
they had taken the time to give me that fix a month earlier. I think part 
of the problem is that they are free for many of the features but are 
paying salaries to support the app. Maybe the app needs to be paid after a 
30 day eval.",3

$39.99 yearly subscription. The kids didn't like it at first, but they're 
used to it now and don't give me grief when their screens get blocked. I 
would like to see an update made to allow for one limit to be set across 
all devices assigned to each child. Currently, if I set the limit at 2 
hours a day, my child gets 2 hours on the phone and 2 hours on the tablet.

how you know a parent doesn't have trust in their child. I can't talk to 
friends without telling my mom to unlock the app for me. It's a pain in the 
ass and very frustrating. At my age, I'm supposed to have friends and talk 
to them in text (since I'm homeschooled), but this app doesn't let me. If 
the child is below 11 or 10, this app is alright. But if the ""child"" is 
over 12, it is best for the parents to not get this app. You'll just ruin

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love it. Kid hates it. I've tried a few apps and this one seems to do the best so far.   Pros: We can pause her phone and all her extra apps (netflix, youtube, snapchat, etc). Once a time limit reaches extra apps are disabled. The phone will still functional with text, facetime, phone calls. I like that once a time limit is reached there are no questions... apps cant be used. I tend to be a pushover and grant extra time but its nice to have the conversation about how much time she is on her phone.   I really like the pause feature. ""Dinner time... dinner time""... Hits pause and like magic she comes out for dinner. When we are reading as a family and she sneaks off. Hit pause with a little note ""come read"" and like magic she comes to read!   Cons: I would like it to be more granular and manage app time .Using facetime, music, and other non app stuff counts towards her time and so she will use her old phone for music. I would like to limit youtube and snapchat only and as of now it doesnt seem to do that. Also, it disorganizes all the apps when they do come back after a pause or limit being reached.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love it! It's got the children's Ipad time back under control and it's stopped us, the parents, from continually harassing them to get off. The app allows them to manage their time better, as they know it's going to shut them out after 40 minutes and so they use the time wisely to watch what they really want instead of sitting there transfixed until we get angry. Everyone happy - including the kids. If Screen Time can find a way to select certain apps to be exempt from the lock out eg spotify and e book readers (both of which we don't mind them using) that would be even better. Highly recommended.",5

it cuts into daily screen time, when adding bonus tasks it seems to include

loves being able to submit when a task is complete and earn more time. 
Sometimes if i catch her doing things without being reminded i turn on 
freeplay and she can have as much time as she wants. That way she doesnt 
feel so restricted. The obly thing i enforce is no phone after bedtime but 
thats always been a rule. I like that i can monitor and adjuat things and i 
like that this helps give her a sense of work ethic and we communicate 
about how much time ahe would like to earn extra. Love this app!",5

came to agreements on times, days, schedules and what apps. they can use, 
ultimately all decisions were agrees on through compromise. We can pause if 
we need them right away, block apps we don't approve. Screen time keep tabs 
what sites are being used without me having to figure how to navigate

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is by far the superior app on the market to monitor and control what 
your kids can do on their electronic devices. The options are too many to 
mention but this app controls the kids screen time by account not device. 
This means it spans all devices the kid uses. You can be extremely granular 
in your control. I give this an A++",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I would suggest all parents with children having smart phones get this app. 
What your kids have access to can be incredibly bad if they don't know what 
they are getting into. I know you see on the news all the time about 
tracking yours kids online usage. This helps tremendously! I have complete 
control over my kids phones. Extremely user friendly and worth every penny. 
It would be nice if could be connected to game console like Xbox one and 
home computer",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Really easy to use. I like the pause feature when my kids don't want to go

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Thoroughly recommended!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I didn't want my son on his phone all the time like I see other kids doing now days. So I downloaded this app to limit his time and block some apps or people if I wanted to. The only thing I would like more about this app is a way to block him from watching videos that I would not approve of,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,You have to pay to be able to set time limits. Don't be fooled it's not free. It's the old bait and switch.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great at monitoring your kids app and internet usage. Also great for setting bed times and blocking apps you don't want your kids using.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It only allowed me to see what site they visited and how long. I needed an app to see what they're doing on the internet, who they talk to, who they send pictures to. Not this at all.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,One of my kids very wuickly figured out how to bypass the password and allow himself more time. The other kid has an iphone and this app made everything completely glitchy so that all his allowed time was spent trying open his games. Probably great for younger kids. Wish I'd had access to something like this earlier. Guess I'll just have to parent 😲.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is ok i hacked it without the password and its stupid to add free play when you still have time left because it will take away your daily limit as well as freeplay time i have a more detailed reveiw about all the problems on the companion app i think it is.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app.  Helps me organize my kids playing time on the tablet and there is no sneaking around.  I love the fact that I can pause it anywhere I am and send my kids a message.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Its works wow amazing the uninstall button works wow!!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The   app does everything is claims and  does it well. Great price for the features. Be wary of the imature reviews by children who are upset that their parents installed this app on their phone. The fact that they are complaining is just another indication that the app works and is not easily circumvented.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app. It has taken the fight out of allowed screen time. Possibility to leave some apps accessible even when phone is locked is great. And everything is controlled from my cell phone. Love it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Suck hey,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Does it still log web and search history, while chrome is in incognito mode? If not the app is useless in keeping kids safe.",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I really do like this app BUT I have both of my kids phone setup on it and it always controls ones phone perfectly and the other it's stops monitoring (i.e. daily limits). If it would control both devices equally it would be excellent!!!,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app. You can manage your child's phone. Needless to say, she hates it",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great App - totally worth it. I'm a single parent and work so monitoring screen/phone time was really hard for me. This is so helpful in helping my son find limits I chose to pay for the full version. It's so nice to have my son back and not have to fight with him about cell/data usage. Instead of him being cut off from the family watching YouTube all night -once his time is up he rejoins our family and we get to spend time with him. It's worth every penny.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app was glitchy and when we removed it, it wiped all of my son's apps from his device.  Where is the complaint department?!?!?  UPDATE- Customer service contacted me within minutes of my review and made this right.   Thank you.",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Our high schooler uninstalled the locked child app from her Andriod phone in less than one minute.   One MAJOR  setup problem in our multilingual family is that this app runs on each device in the device's set language and NOT in the language set by THE PARENT'S  device.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,App does nothing on free version.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app.  It has helped cut down our kids screen time very effectively.  It is easy to add time for certain circumstances and allows us to require other activities before the kids can have more screen time.  Best app I have gotten in a very long time.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great for my little sister that is downloading apps that have virus,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is entirely too complicated to set up. It says to enter the pairing code on my kids device when asked but it never does. Useless,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Finally everything I need in one app! I used to use 3 different apps to almost get the kind of service this one app provides... and more!! Its been a great aid for my busy single mom lifestyle and my child is adjusting well to these clear boundaries.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very easy to set-up! I understand how to use it! Works perfectly on my daughter's android. No more battles!!! Wish I had this 4 years ago!!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Being able to keep track and control what is allowed on my kids devices is what I have been looking for and now I have it with this app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Thank you! This app has been really helpful in managing screen time.  I there was a way to control the browser from within this app by domain I would love it even more since our kids use many browser-based educational apps...but end up on Amazon if left to their own devices...  :/,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Incredible tool to use as a parent.  I love the control and visibility.  This helps me teach my kids how to use their phone as a tool so that they learn increased responsibly. Money well spent.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I bought the year subscription and am loving it right now. My son is proactively doing tasks. At 8 allowance doesn't mean much to him but extra screentime he understands.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's good while it works. And it does most of the time. The annoying thing is that when the child disable or remove it (and that's possible) you get no warning. And configuration it back is not always working smoothly.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has been great but three weeks ago, it stopped working. I can't block apps or see correct usage data. I've gone through three customer service people and none of them can figure it out and aren't being very helpful in diagnosing the issue. Maybe this review will get someone's attention.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Doesnt work. Hit pause and you think you're all great and mighty dad but my child can still use his device.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I like that i can send my son tasks to complete to earn time. This way he learns to spend time wisely.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I would recommend this to anybody it was the best $3.99 I ever spent I can actually watch everything my child does. I can even limit herself to what she can play with and I can also block apps,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It lacks too many obvious and needed requirements, e.g. school holidays, sharing time on multiple devices etc.(it just gives the child double time) And it's not easy to uninstall on a device! Even the link to assist does not work. Considering this was a pro version trial it worked more like a free version. Sorry guys, you have to do better than this. I will look elsewhere for a suitable app.",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app for keeping tabs on your kids screen usage and controlling access to bad content. Love it! I see kids rating this App poorly.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Simply put. I love this app I can control everything once and don't have to worry about daily activity. Only thing I complain about is that I have to pay for premium with my credit card or PayPal, I should be able to charge to my mobile carrier bill like every other app. It's the one thing that's stopping me from paying for premium.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app for monitoring your children's devices!  Perfect,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I was looking for a program that was effective in stopping my 12 year old son from losing contact with the world,friends in exchange of cyberspace. Screen time offered more than that, my son and I discussed reasonable terms of use in all his devices, how to earn extra time, without it being excessive, with the exception when we go on long travel days. He loves the reward system in place and he is much more focused on his studies, communication at home apreciates on/off time. Thank so much ScreenTime Team 👍  Now in our 2nd year going and I couldn't be more pleased, especially with all the excessive use of technologies. I have the peace of mind with Screen time.   MY son embraces it because we discuss how the over use is impacting on his development. Now we're both in control. Thank you screen time team. 😉",5

No paying per device, all inclusive app can monitor multiple children and devices at once. Highly recommended!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Easy to set limits for both of my kids individually. I don't need to worry about confiscating their devices at night because the app can lock them out of their apps at bedtime automatically. If my child needs to put the device away to do homework or activities, I can lock access to their apps remotely if they are not listening.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a parent, I was severely disappointed by this app",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Overall the app works as advertised. I do have some issues with it. For each kid, you need to set the app allowance and timers separately, which can take some time. I wish there was a template that can be used again. The other issue so far is the screen time doesn't aggregate different devices for the same child together and monitors each separately. So if you have 1.5 hours allowed for a kid, if he has two devices, then it becomes 1.5 hours per device. This needs to be fixed.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app, and now that my kids are getting used to it it is working very well for my family.  I wish it had a five minute warning for my kids just to let them know that their time is almost up, I thought there was one at one point but I could never get it working, and now I can't find it at all.  I also wish there was a chore log that I could reference at the end of the week / month to show the kids where their strengths are in helping out the family household,and allocate allowances. Thank you : )",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love the block function (at first had a few bugs but now fixed) which enables me to shut down my daughters device when she isnt doing what she is supposed to.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My wife and I love this app! We have it installed on our daughter's devices and it works wonderfully. We gave it a try, and easily decided to purchase the monthly subscription. It has many great features. My personal favorite is being able to set tasks that reward the kids with some time. I find it highly effective at having them get their responsibilities taken care of before they can have screen time. Setting the bedtime is also a great feature.  If you are even thinking you need to  ge this app, just do it. Really, you already know and you'll be thrilled you did.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app messes up your phone big time!! Do not download! I used an iPhone to try it out with and it downloaded a profile that refused to be removed again.

She makes a mess in my kitchen Simon Says no phone all day until clean...Lol....She has more energy now getting up for school..

Now when I ask them to do something, if they don't listen, or if they say something like ""in a minute"" I can just pause their screen. It was easy to install, and it's easy to set up. I can check what do, make sure they are not doing anything they shouldn't be. And I don't have to worry about them spending too much time using their devices. It's awesome.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have multiple devices in the house, between 4 children, and we can't always monitor them as we are either always on the run, or having downtime.  Screen Time helps us absolutely manage when the kids can use their devices, how long, and get bonus time for chores. And for our older children, they can choose money or screen time for chores.    It's really a no brainer for us to help limit when they use their screen and make them realize there is more to the world than just their screen.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This was an alright app but if they have free play it takes off the screen time aswell.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,A very good tool to remove parents headache in managing their phone usage. The current features are great and more to come will be even greater,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent app.....does exactly what it's designed for,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,its great and usefull for anyone,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It does what we want which is why purchased it. However, it does NOT change time zones when their phones do which is a problem.  My daughter was having a temper tantrum about not being able to use her phone due to the time, then we arrived to our vacation and there is a time change - she is able to use her phone in the middle of the night without us knowing the first night (we obviously figured it out). Good news is that my daughter complained about the effectiveness of the app so much on the way to put destination that we had other parents inquire about the app so we showed them. They were intrigued and are looking into it for their children.  It is effective, love that we can remotely control when they can use their phone, add and subtract time, put a to do list for them and I don't mind checking in on our kids at all.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very happy. Every chore becomes a task and that equals screen time. My son is actually doing things around the house to get some time. Great App!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a really good app for my kids in which they are learning how to manage their time a little more appropriately. And I can control everything from my phone! 😊,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's okay,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My son is still able to use apps that are suppose to be blocked using the minimized mode of the app such as YouTube. Please fix this. I like this app very much and it works for the most part aside from this flaw.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Spent a lot of time looking into parental controls for my kids and this one is fantastic. Free trial and yes you will need to pay to continue the full package but it's not much and if you have more than 1 kid its a 1 off payment. My kids hate it but as a parent its well worth the money,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I absolutely love it. My kids not so much but that means it's working,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I like it, I am a 12y old child and I am ok with me having screen time!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Very good to setup all sorts of ways your child can use their electronics. You can schedule different access for different times and change those same settings on the fly. Overall I am extremely satisfied. The only reason I didn't give a five is that there have been some issues with how it calculated free time into the daily minutes, and over the years other small issues, but the developers really seem to continue to work on these and I really like the most recent changes to how you can personalize the schedules throughout the day. Definitely worth the money.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"love this app, we've used this as a trial in January and purchased in Feb, the $3.99/month is worth every penny as we see our daughters grades go up, chores done around the house to get screen time. this is cheaper than a tutor that's $50/hr and allowance for chores. my daughter hates it of course but it works.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I just recommended this app to my sister. Can't get much more positive than that. One feature I would like is to be able to designate one or two phone numbers that the device can always call or text even when in lock down mode.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Sucks,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a must have app for anyone with kids.  I don't want my children wasting their lives away staring at a phone.  It teaches them to manage their time.  They are more than willing to do their assigned chores to earn more screen time which teaches them to work for what they want.  I can disable dangerous apps or not approve them to be added to their phone.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is awsome!! It help  a lot, thank you guys for this app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Highly recommended. I love this app Help me a lot.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Worst app. Blocks everything even for the parent. They make it extremely difficult to uninstall. Will never use this app again.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app is great for Android devices, but for iphones it doesnt work well at all. I cant see what my kids are doing or how long they are on. Lists at restricted. Also my error when they try to minimize app. Considering getting rid of this. I paid for the entire year up front.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's a great app.  It helps to monitor what the kids are looking at and easily allows you to control the amount if time they use it.  My only problem is that sometimes it stops tracking one of the devices history and wgen I try and contact for help it gives me error messages.  The bedtime blocker always works however I haven't figured out how to set different times for the weekend.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very very impressed! Exactly what I've been looking for. Allows me to monitor both children and set bedtimes. Different times available for weekends to weekdays recognising that kids have treats on weekends.  Already recommended to friends.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Added this for my kids' phones (10 & 13) to limit their screen time.  I like the reward feature to give extra time for completed tasks.  Also nice to be able to see what they've searched for online (though this feature has limits).  Part of me wishes I could also review numbers called and content of texts sent, but that might be asking a lot.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app actually is good and what am looking for.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I'm very pleased with the application as I know how much time my kids spend on mobile, but on the other hand, they learn how to manage their time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love being able to monitor the use of my kids electronics. I especially love the ""pause"" feature..... I do wish there was a way to be able to get into some of their apps and see what they are doing, but overall love this app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The simplest parental control app ever!!! Let's me know what is going on love it!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app works fine, but it is not free as it suggests!",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app, very easy to use! My daughter will do extra chores for more screen time 😁",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is the best app ever! I can monitor what apps my kids are using and I can completely shut the apps off at a scheduled bedtime! So even if my kids sneak their phones into their bedrooms at night, they can't play games or text!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Overall great app and the customer service is really quick to answer questions. They also take advice from parents that use the app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Not a good app for me. I have 3 kids 2 devices  each but after it would not even install on my son's phone I only put it on their phones. It still never worked for my son. You are suppose to be able to disable the apps but when you try to get the apps back it would go haywire  on one Iphone. Let's just say it never  really worked right,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a great way to control and monitor screen time and still allow your kids access to thier devices.  You know it is working really well when all the ""1"" ratings are kids who hate the limits or oversight.  I recommend this for every parent who gives thier kids access to the internet.  Even if you never limit time you can see what apps they are using and help them responsibly manage what they are doing.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Waste of time,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Lately we are having issues with chat heads from messenger functioning during blocks times.  Update resolved.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is so wonderful!  My daughter and I no longer argue over hours much time she spends on her phone.  I love being about to monitor time and internet content.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As an IT Administrator for a well known company and as a parent I can say this app works well and does the job all at an affordable price. Sure I can do the same with my ""IT"" skills but at the great cost for this app why waste my time :) My kids hate it though but that just means it works. As yet I cannot find a problem. Great for safeguarding my kids from the bad side of technology.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I absolutely love this app! It is allowed me to ensure that my son does not exceed his allotted amount of screen time every day. With the help of screen time I now I know what apps are being used when, and that there's no question whether or not certain apps are being used during school hours or bedtime. As a single mother who is a full-time student, and works two jobs, this really set my mind at ease knowing that I don't personally have to police the amount of time any electronic devices are used at home.  I highly recommend this app to all parents!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,No more fights in our house.  I always had to fight my kids to get off the tablet.  No more.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The Paused function doesn't work suddenly. Now my kids play with his phone as long as he wishes.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"first do not work on all devices (Chromebooks are not part of the list) second, the app keep blocking the calling function even when there is no restriction given.   so it do not allow the kid to use the phone for what it is design for, so you end up opening all restrictions since the menu options are numerous and complicate, and therefor that make the app useless",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"When kids complain, it means the app is working. Couldn't be happier with its educational effect. Thank you, Screen Time, from a grateful mother.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great help to make sure my kids are not on the tablet all night,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is very bad,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Would be even better if you guys added a volume control!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Found it very useful,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Very good for a single device, not ready for prime time if your child has 2 or more devices.  I'm a parent, I bought the subscription for this app, and if your child only has one single device, the app works very well.   However, if your child has, say, one phone, one tablet, and perhaps a laptop computer for homework, this app kind of misses the point.  A time limit only works per device. So if you set a time limit for 2 hours a day, then your child can just switch from the phone to the tablet after 2 hours and continue to play. The Windows laptop can't be controlled at all.  This is very difficult to understand, since you get very useful emails with a daily summary the following day for all devices combined. If they can combine the screen time here, why not in the app?  Unfortunately, it seems as if this company is devoting the resources to develop a ""sister app"" that tracks content, texting, browsing etc. I think they will end up with 2 half baked applications  that work on a small scale, but only half way.  It would be better to finish the first app to make it work across devices, and then venture into new fields.  I like the idea of this app very much, as I am mostly concerned about total screen time per day. I'm not really interested in every text msg they send, some privacy is fine and should be there.   But if it can't limit the screen time across devices (even if it reports this the next day per email) then it misses the point. The other features work well, I had it for a couple of months now. Sometimes it gets stuck when  I pause the devices, and then turn it back on. My son needs to reboot sometimes, but that's only once in a while.  The main deficiency really is the lack of a meaningful combination of the time spent on different devices.  I will now check out other software that has this feature that I'm looking for. Even if it costs more money,  that's fine, but at least it should be doing what it's supposed to do.  All other feature work as advertised, so if you have a child with one device, this inexpensive solution will probably work for you.  If they combine the time limits across devices, they will have me back as a customer again.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,There has not been a single argument in our home over devices since installing this app. The best part is the children feel they are in control of their screen time. Highly recommend!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I'm really pleased with this app. It's opened up dialogue with my children regarding screen time and helps them understand work/reward. A few bugs but good overall. Even my son has asked me to block some apps so he's not tempted,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The parent interface is great and I really liked it. Based on user interface and features I was set to pay for the premium version after the trial. The problem being that my child's iphone seemed to have WiFi disabled when the blocks came on wether scheduled or me pausing use, then the next time useage was allowed the app didn't receive anything to enable apps again nor could I do it myself on the device. Can't be bothered with that all the time so unfortunately it's a no go.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Kids can uninstall it from their device and it is not notified to parents at the 1st place. It was informed after kids did so twice. Installation instructions are confusing and incomplete.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is great for controling usage of yor children phones.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app. it has encouraged my daughter to do simple tasks as I've set them as tasks for additional time so there are no more arguments about making het bed, doing homework etc. I really love being able to pause her screen time when I need her instant attention and the ability to send a message about why the time has been paused. my daughter likes it because she now gets some screen time instead of having her tablet confiscated which was what wad happening before. thank you",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app needs to be paid to access full benefits. Dont waste your time. Easily hacked.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's okay don't know if I'm going to keep it pass a month as only thing I can really do is limit his time I can't see what apps he's using or anything else,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is intended for children who are old enough to hack the password protection.  Until Screen Time comes up with better security against this, it's more or less useless.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have great kids, and just like anyone else,  they use their devices as a distraction. This app has helped me as a parent be more aware of the content they view so we can talk about real issues. The time limit function enabled my kids now realize how much time they spent before was just mindless surfing rather than taking care of their responsibilities. They now use their apps with a purpose, to look things up, communicate effectively, and get back to life. Using the blocker I can limit access to or completely block any app, and the responsiveness between my device to theirs is very fast. There is a time reward system for task completion, while they may complain initially, they now see how things weren't getting done before hand too. Content in any form is something that should be talked about anytime and through the history log I can address new viewing trends and habits as they are forming, it helps me to be more proactive than reactive. Not only that but it helps me so I can see what they are interested in or thinking about. It's not a nanny service but I've found it as a good tool to help monitor device usage so I can redirect their attention to things that are useful and matter most to us too. Parenting isn't easy, never has been, I'm just thankful this tool has made our experience, as parents and kids/teens/soon to be young adults, a better and more open one.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Says it's a free app but it isn't. You're given a trial premium sub which only lasts 7 days. The functionality is useless after that. Not a good model IMHO. Good for seven days but what's the point of that,2

YOU KNOW IT IS A GREAT APP WHEN the phrase ""I'm going to lock your tablet"" is suddenly motivation for my child to pick up his toys, do some homework and also drop the attitude and sass.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I like it because I get more time after I finish my tasks so my parents can approve it.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's is the perfect tool to motivate and make kids appreciate other things in life like excerise, homework, and acts of kindness just to name a few. I have had several people inquire about this service and I highly recommend it!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I think it's a wonderful app. I let the  children know that I'm still in control.  They  better be grateful they do have a phone.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,G ate it,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Decided to give it a try but uninstalled it the next day. It deleted apps out of my daughter's ipod and keeps doing it every time after you push the button to get them back. We then uninstalled the screentime app from her ipod but it is still there removing her other apps when she tries to use them!!,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's horibleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Let me be honest here. I'm a 'child', but I can't deny that this app does wonders to keep us off our phones once in a while. There's a few things that I think deserve massive attention, though. First, the bedtime blocker for some reason completely bars all apps other than Clock and Contacts (that includes manually allowed apps, such as WhatsApp, Phone and Settings) on some devices, but works fine on others. This bug also only works from 11 pm onwards, which means parents who use bed blockers at a time earlier might not notice this. And before you ask, we're this isn't the Lights Out. Second, it might be a little more convenient if the time spent on Free Play Mode did not add to the daily limit plan, but this might be optional, I guess. Overall, this app needs improvement to be useful as blocking out distractions for children on an everyday basis, and as a motivation to do chores or tasks that might be beneficial later in life. It just needs a few tweaks, and bug fixes, to make sure that the phone can still be used as, well, a phone, at any time, even at night, without much issues.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Its ok,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome!  It works perfectly.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app!! I do wish it would tell me who my daughter is calling and texting and what her text say but other than that, it's everything we were looking for!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Good app, does it what it's supposed to. Sometimes it just isn't very user-friendly. The orders may not go through and there is things that could be fixed with the layout of the app.   I also think that seeing the websites & apps the child is visiting should be optional and possible to hide. I'm not visiting the info but it would be nicer if you could completely hide them/turn the tracking off. While I do want to be able to control the sleeping times I feel it's wrong to pry into a teenagers private life.   The kids do not enjoy it but they realize that if they attempt to uninstall the app or find workarounds the will lose their phones. Having them in the first place is a luxury, not a necessity.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I've been using the app for a year and has been working well. My teenager was recently able to overwrite the settings to making it disabled. I submitted feedback to them. Looks like it's a flaw the way the app works and it can be disabled by taking advantage of multiple screens on phones where one can go into settings and disable the overlay options for screentime. This effectively makes the app useless. They refunded my money. Now looking for another app.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Cliches hard to control,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So much information and control available at my fingertips. Helps my kids with their screen addiction and helps them to focus on priorities.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app. It is well worth the $3.99 a month. I can limit my son's usage, reward him with extra time, limit the apps he has access to and see exactly what he is doing. I can ""Pause"" his usage and ""Play"" when I need to.  He hates it. I love it!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It would be helpful if you mention up front that all the useful features need to be paid for!,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app...except my son uninstalled it in 2 minutes showing me how easy it was to do. We have since remedied that problem but was  upset that it could happen so easily and quickly.  If screen time could provide a GPS function in the future we would be grateful.  Sometimes teenagers aren't completely truthful on their whereabouts.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It was great until my son figured out that all he has to do is reboot the phone and until screen time is reopened its not active. Everything was installed per your instructions. Phone is a Meizu m710h android 6.,3

I can see everything he goes on. That is a plus. But I would rather be able to block these apps instead of monitoring them.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a very useful app. Helps parents understand how the child is using their gadgets and therefore able to guide them to useful sites, apps and tools. The trick to getting your child on board is this: talk to them BEFORE installing Screen Time. Get their agreement and answers their questions. Sign the contract. And, avoid reading their messages without their permission. We've been on the app for a couple of months now and so far no issues - technical or with our son.",4

We both love that they can do tasks for extra time.  Their room has never been so clean! Fully customizable for your schedules. I love that I can see everything they are doing in real time. I'll give a fifth star once it will track total time across multiple devices per child!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's super stupid it stinks.  how do you bypass it  I hate it all my son's broke it,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love!!! I highly recommend! This app is installed on my 16 year old step sons phone and we love it! It does not show all his txt messages or Web history so we showed him he still has his privacy. Also disable settings so he can't Uninstall it and make sure your kid doesn't reboot the whole phone. We installed it because at school he was on snap so much he was showing up late to classes. We love the pause feature also. So during school he can make phone calls to anyone. During bed he can't do anything and if he is late to classes we can turn it off for the day or whatever. He has gotten so much better with sleep and showing up to class on time. I think he secretly likes it too. Naturally he has started using his phone less as well. He use to stay up till 3 am sometimes on snap and now he gets his sleep and is in a better mood all together. Love this app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I'm a parent, and this app has been a wonderful tool for me to use when we were having some homework issues with my son. Instead of taking his entire phone away, using Screen Time ensures he spends his time doing what he SHOULD be doing with his phone.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Amazing app, in the beginning our kids went furious, in the meantime they learned to live with it. The app helped us to make them aware of the hours they had spent every day gaming, step by step reduced their gamin time per day, they manager their gaming time much better since they know that there is a daily limit. One can lock certain apps, in general case by case or day by day. It’s possible to define a reward system. They daily overview helps to see with what kind of games they spend their time. We didn’t block and excluded the learning apps from the daily limit. This means that they can still use these apps even if they have reached their daily gaming limit. Important is that you talk to them first, tell them why you install it and what the mutual goal shall be. Another great feature is the “pause” function which you can activate any time with a click. If they are gaming, I try to call them, they don’t react I press “pause” , send thema message and within 2 minutes they will stay in front of you – lol. The flexibility of the settings is great. The developer is our new hero!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Too easy to uninstall,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very effective app. Love that you have so much control over their screen time. The task option is a great motivator for them to do chores. Only drawback is that the app doesn't let you see which apps your kids are using if they have an iPhone.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,After you spend 15 minutes setting it all up it then informs you that you have to pay $4 per month to actually limit screen time. These people are Crooks and I wouldn't trust them with my data,1

I have only had this for 24 hours and have not yet had it work correctly yet. Does not bode well.  If it happens a third time I have promised to delete the app and use an alternative app because he is getting upset. Each time this app ""hides"" apps on the child device you lose your folders and any pre-arranged order. I am trying to solve an issue not aggravate it.  Might have to try ScreenLimit or Kaspersky.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It worked initially the first day. Apps I blocked didn't open but it all opened the following day.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Premium member. It worked until my husband figured out how easy it is to disable on your phone. Even if you have the system settings disabled on your phone through screen time. All the child phone has to do is keep on hitting the settings button enough usually 2 or 3 times and it allow you to get into the settings and disable all the app permissions needed for the child to use the phone as the child sees fit.,1

I don't want to invade my daughter's privacy but i do want to make sure she's not staying up until midnight on her phone because I've caught her a couple times and she lied about it and went back to using it and that needed to stop real quick. With this i can see if an app is in use and set limits so i don't have to nag. I prefer not to have to resort to this and i normally don't but it got my point across. I rarely use this but it's there if needed to be paused.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is great for Android. (Tried them all.) This is the best. Some bugs to still iron out. The iPhone it doesn't work so well. Crashes. (Better than the others tho'),4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love the app I can see what my child's doing daily I can stop his phone and tablet with a single app only thing I think would be better if I could control each item separately instead of them being together that way he wouldn't get out of time for both for the chores that he does,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Best app ever.. you can give bonus time for reading,  cleaning room, your choice.  To be honest , I wish we never got tablets for the kids. This keeps you in control. Get this",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,As a parent this is an app that has help me a lot i just block all the apps from my phone when my daughter does not follow her schedule. I highly recommend it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My biggest problem with the app is that it constantly locks apps on my son's phone and when it does the location services are locked too so my GPS tracker app I use to keep tabs on his whereabouts doesn't work. That is a huge issue for me. Also after installation it seems to have hijacked content permission and restricted all media content to ""clean"" and I am unable to modify it which is also a problem because I'm using the app on a teenager and restricting all his music to clean versions is one battle too many for me to fight right now.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The best management app to keep you aware of your children's device use.. and your own!! You will be surprised how much time is spent in front of a screen! Excellent app support and fast response to any questions. A+,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Gets the job done... Now I have a son, not zombie in the morning.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"So far so good.  With a lot of apps, there is always room for improvement and I love the tasks and being sure there is a bedtime routine!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works well and was exactly what I was looking for in order to effectively manage the screen time of my two daughters (ages 4 and 9). Price for premium features is also very reasonable.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I hate this app. Please don't download it. It is horrible,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I think it's a very good app once your kind doesn't know how to skip EVERYTHING!!!! my daughter find out how and it's super easy!!!! Do you know that the kid just need to create a new user on the cell and everything will work and in the parents side it won't even show that your kid is using the cellphone!!! So that's the bad thing for me because it TOTALLY destroy the porpoise of the app..... .so I guess that you should work on that because it will be a much better app if you can solve that.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,As an adault looking after kids this app is so important. I have the ability to control what and how much they see and use. Love this app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Hated it.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Not a free app. Doesn't offer anything without paying.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Best app I've found for keeping the kids happy, and working with the family instead of face down on their screens.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I thought it was good for awhile then the app locked my child's phone and the end for the app for us; was it deleted my child's apps.  Very frustrating!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very easy to use.  I love it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Waste of time,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great way to monitor the amount of screen time your child has each day. We love this app and recommend it to our friends often!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I found this app after struggling to get my kids off their screens and to help them understand how much time they were on them. This has been a great tool to understand and limit our kids screen time usage. The app is easy to use and gives a great level of detail. I really appreciate the ability to allow for certain apps to be allowed (for communication) and the flexibility it gives us. The pause button is also fantastic! Our only complaint is that this can't be used on our Chromebook yet, but the team has been responsive and friendly with our questions.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Of course my kids hate this app. But it really is genius.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My husband's ex wife and I use this to monitor our collective kids... Its SO easy and works SO great! So glad for an app like this! & we love the fact that her and I can both control time/apps :),5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app for parents. Ignore the grumpy kid reviews as this means the app is obviously working!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app...,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It works well for the most part. I just paid for my second year of subscription. It's nice to monitor what my kids are up to and I have the ability to pause their tablets or give them extra time as needed. The one issue I have is that it seems more often lately the app States I don't have a current subscription. And I'm unable to login as it says my email is not registered. Usually the problem is rectified within 12 hours but this is inconvenient when I cannot monitor my teenagers device,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Unfortunately the APP did not live up to the hype. After following the instructions about how to make sure the APP cannot be removed, our son went online and looked up how to disable it and successfully did so.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,As mother to an autistic teen that has problems transitioning to one activity to another. I found that this app helped a lot. It gives him plenty of warning before shutting down. I love that I can set a scedule for him and his brother. That way they can play and do other activities without having me demand they put their electronics away. Also like the price at $20 every 6 months. You totally can't beat that,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's very easy to use and it really has helped in avoiding the struggle of having to remind my daughter when it is time for her to get off her device. She knows the set schedule and the app does the rest.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My wife and I love it!!! The kids hate it 😂😂,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It used to work great, but now I am wasting 10 minutes trying to add 5 minutes of play to my son's device. I'm rarely successful though. Only removing the app works. Pointless",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My kids are 4 & 5. It has taught them the appreciation of tablet time and play time in a little over a month :-),5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is great,  allows me to set limits on my children's devices",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great job.  This app is so easy to use with 3 devices and stops the arguments with kids.  Great features with pause, add more time and messages to kids too!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Super easy and works great.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good appXX,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app!!  Solves two major problems in our household...chores and screen time 😀.  Wish I could see which apps are used on daughter's iphone but so far great app and great service!!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love to keep my children safe,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Seems to work pretty well however my daughter seems to have found a way around the time limit, any idea how it's done and how to stop it?",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My child can go to settings and switch it of..then a red screen appear on my side. How do i stop that,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love that I can watch what my kids are doing, but I wish that I could give them extra time once in a while that isn't on a timer like the screenplays.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Worth the money! The power to pause the phone is a wonderful thing with my four kids (ages 11-16). My kids do their homework and chores without having to be asked so they can have more screen time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Most functionalities are in the pro version,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very helpful and ended the tantrums!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I really like all of the features it does have.   Lots of positives.  I love the total daily limit time I can set.  It has reduced the amount of arguing and whining by quite a bit.  They also seen me willing to do tasks for more screen time.  I love being able to pause their tablets when it's done time.  No more ""can I just finished this"" and it gets their attention the first time.  I don't have to get the point yelling because they are ignoring me or try digging hear be because of the tablets.  The time of day restriction is nice.  Tablets are useless after 7pm for bedtime and I have another set on Sunday morning.  No tablet time before Church.  It's not perfect bet getting ready for church is definitely easier.  Same with school.  I think the reason I didn't rate it a 5 is because we really need a time limit you can set on specific apps too.  My son will  use it all on YouTube. I noticed this in the area you can review how long they spend on each app.  I know this would really be asking for an enhancement tho. I have also noticed that when The kids devices are not tethered to WiFi, the parameters don't seem to be enforced and while my kids don't know how to disable wifi yet, they learned this very quickly one day I let them take their tablets while we had some things to do out of the house.  I look forward to Future enhancements, hint hint, wink wink😉",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,If this app was free it very good,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The installation is very troublesome,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I use it to limit my kids time on their phones and monitor what they are looking at. They are 8 and 12. They understand its to teach them responsibility and we abide by the phone time as well. Its a great app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I purchased the yearly subscription because I really liked the layout and available options. One major problem though, I found that sometimes the blocked periods weren't working or my child got around it. I was notified of his attempts to circumvent the app and was able to see when he was on during blockes periods so that made up for the original issue. Overall I like using the app and its not complicated. I'd like to see GPS availability though.  Thanks!!",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,App is more of a virus.  Impossible to remove. Unhelpful support.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I use this for both my kids.  Beware that if the bedtime, time limit or blocked apps are initiated you must uncheck phone and contacts (at least on android phones) for your child to be able to make emergency calls.  I think this is the one big flaw with this app.  It would be nice if they added an emergency call feature that allowed calls to 911 and a specified phone number. It also does not show me what sites my child has visited however it does tell me when she uses her browser so I can check up on history.  I love most other features,  especially the ability to pause and give play time.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it that you can pause the whole tablet,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great 👍 👍 👍,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Has worked incredibly to control screen time. I don't have to worry about their phones and bedtime anymore either.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love it!  The only thing we wish it had was a separate weekend control, we find our selves having to change the bedtime hours on Friday and Saturday because he's out later at friends or school events.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"it worked as described. but my kid is able to remove it, even after i put it in device admin and put app lock to protect settings. i restricted play store too from screen time. but while android starts up ...1st few seconds applock didnt worked. so he could get to settings and remove it.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,You should advertise that it costs monthly. Very effective and easy to use.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This has been the perfect way to stop the yelling over all of the screen time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Stupid,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is horrible and it says you can do stuff but you can't. I think you should not get it,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I'm sorry for only two stars, but my 7 years son surprisingly somehow uninstalled this app without any evidence. However, nice idea to manage children time they spend on tablets.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I tried several other apps before finally finding Screentime which trumps others on the market by a distance. It's simple to use, intuitive, easy for the kids to get to grips with and amazing support staff online to help where needed. Even for those kids who will always find a way to crack controls, Screentime's ""made by parents"" really helps the conversation that this isn't just me being concerned - there are other parents too. 5 stars, without question.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is defenetly great and verry useful with our two kids. The app had some errors on their phone and the support team explained that it's an issue with that specific phone model.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good App. Help me keep track of my children screen time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a parent that had let play time on tablets get out of control, on the first day we installed screen time we were pleasantly surprised when our 3 kids immediately accepted the fact that their screen time was limited. Totally unexpected.   The app itself is great. Full featured, incentive-based tasks work well with our kids too. Automated schedules & time tracking make it as easy for the parents to monitor & control as it is for the kids to pick up their tablets.  The only issue that kept a 5-star rating was that one of our iPhones would continuously erase apps as if the app was deleted from the phone. Would then have to go thru the process of recovering them. Annoyance. Not sure if it's an iPhone issue or glitch with the app.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I don't have to fight over the phone amymore. This has helped extraordinarily in getting him to do his schoolwork and getting proper sleep time! Easy to use and the ability to add more free time when he completes assigned tasks is awesome! Worth every penny!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I call it the magic button, because the minute I pause all their devices they all come out to see what they need to do to get their tablets back! I can also block out school and sleep time so they can call me from the phone, but not play games when they're supposed to be learning. I do wish I could install it on the laptop and TVs, then it would be perfect!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I think it is good to use,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app gives you control over the tablet or phone of your kids. It works really well.,5

Can you please try to fix this? It is very frustrating at times.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good app.  Wish it had some additional features.  I've submitted my suggestions.  We'll see if they listen.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Crashes system UI,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app. I can monitor what my child does on her tablet daily and control the amount of time that she uses it. It has improve her communication with me and assist with creating more structure. I think she's happy with. Because after a year of losing her privilege to use any electronic device. She gets a chance to earn our trust back,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Prety good at telling you what your kid is doing. Helped me catch something before it got to be a problem and helped start a conversation that was needed that I might have missed.  Suggestions: Allow specific apps or functions to be accessible all the time. While a schedule preventing apps during school hrs is great, I bought her a phone for 1 main reason, to help keep her safe. If she can't txt or call at any time what's the point. Also, when I needed to locate her, app didn't help.",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Its great to know that my children wont overuse the smartphone. Its small pay comparing to the benefit that the parents gain. I have but one problem, when i click the pause button on parents device, the child's device stop, but when i click resume, the child's device still stop and cant be used except the call feature, and the device must be restarted. Another thing, could you possibly add filter when children surfing internet so i have peace in mind?. By the way, great job guys, and keep improvising.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I loved the free trial so much I went ahead and paid for the subscription. The features are totally worth it. My only qualm is that I don't see an option to switch my payments from PayPal to my credit card. The app itself though is fantastic.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We had an issue at home with our son playing videogames and watching youtube too often on his phone. By communicating appropriately the benefits of using the app, we were able to reduce the time he spends on his phone and allow him to focus more other things in life. The app has some very nice features and is really super-easy to use. I really like, for example, the fact that you can block certain apps only and allow the kid to use the phone for calls and texting outside of the blocked period or after the daily time allowance has been reached. The kids pay complain when you restrict the use of their smart phones / tablets, however it's all about communication and presenting the benefits of not using the phone all day... I think many parents can be grateful to the Screentime team.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My dad put this app on my phone and I slowed my phone and tablet down so much every time I try to type it lags so much.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is amazing. Very easy to use and efficient! would really like to be able to see texts and pictures they are taking. . is this possible?,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I totally love this application as it is very easy to manage. I appreciate the feature-set that allows you  to immediately block the device you are managing when punishing your child for poor behavior ... you're able to do this while being miles away from the device. I like how things are broken down into daily schedules and bedtime as we don't want our children playing on their tablets after 8pm. This is awesome.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Very good solution, good support and it has very flexible and wide feature set.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app teaches our kids discipline and commitment. They now are more aware of their time when using their devices. It works like a charm in Android. I love the Task Creation feature as it teaches the concept of reward system.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app allows me to monitor my children's screen usage and keep up with our busy life.  As a rule I don't pay for apps but this one was worth it for the help it's given me in our tech saturated world. I only wish it could be installed on some older chomebooks the kids use for school,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Work as advertised. As simple as that :),5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Brilliant app, had a slight issue but we're very quick in replying and letting me know when the issue was fixed, my son hates it but then I love it as I can do trol everything, the best bit is when he says ""no mum I've not used my phone"" I can then check the app and see exactly what he has been using and how long for",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"For us, and we are still working through it, this app has helped restore focus when digital media proves to be too distracting.  I know kids may not be a fan of this app, and they may get angry, but this is a great way to introduce balance again.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has helped me set boundaries for screen usage. My kids have a set time everyday to play on their tablets.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's a great idea if it works.  But it doesn't.  My 12  year old was constantly taking it off his phone.  Even when I downloaded it following the instructions they gave me he still managed to uninstalled it.  This happened daily so I didn't get any benefit of the free trial at all!  Very disappointed indeed  😔,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I'm marking this down purely to get a reply for my problem.  At the moment the app is causing more hassle than it's worth by making my daughters iphone buggy;  1 Her apps have to be rearranged back into folders when they appear back on her phone.  2 Her screen won't scroll to her second page of apps without annoyingly instantly springing bacback to her first page of apps causing her phone to be unusable.  I've only had the app for one day! Is this common? Any solutions?  I may have to uninstall the app if it continues.,2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Powerful,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best $4 I spend each month. Since I've installed this there's no more counting minutes and arguing about getting off the phone. When time is up the phone goes away. It's really simple to add more time for certain occasions as needed also. The program can be a bit buggy once in a while and wasn't the easiest to install so for that I give it 4 stars but I would still recommend it.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Ok so I loved this app with Android but it does not seem to work the same with my daughter's apple. From the Android I could set all the limits and do whatever I wanted on the device but no matter what I do I can not do that on the apple.,2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I never write reviews and I am writing this.  Best christmas present I've got in years.  We homeschool and I list all their assignments and chores as tasks.  Then they do them and send me a pic of the completed work.  Their daily limit is low but they earn screen time with the tasks bonus time. No nagging, no ""I  forgot"",  no wandering to non school apps during work time. And on a field trip I can unlock all their games for the trip with the tap of a button.  I love how I get full control of apps allowed at different times of day and how I can make certain apps always allowed (sure sweetie, you can read your book as long as you like- that doesnt count  against your play time).

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has been an incredibly helpful tool. I have two children 15 and 10 and it has made parenting so much easier. No more melt-downs or arguments over turning off devices during dinner, homework time or bed time. I can easily reward them with extra time if they complete chores and now with the customized times I have even greater control. I also love the school time blocker. If you notice your child spending too much time on apps when they should be paying attention you can simply block all social media apps during class time. Only leaving open apps they might actually need such as Google docs, internet, calculator ect... I also love that the developers are always interested in hearing feedback and suggestions to improve upon an already great app. They are all very friendly and get back to requests in a timely fashion. Great app. Totally worth the money. If I had the option to gicec10 stars I would.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Been using for a month now.  Set up and agreed limits with my 12 year old son and set targets for earning extra time.  He agreed he had been spending too much time on his phone/tablet and we talked about it before choosing an app.  So far so good, working well and he's spent far less time on his own in his room looking at a screen.  He's being more selective with how he spends his now limited screen time.   Only thing I would like to see added is the option for different bedtimes at the weekend.  I can give a higher allowance at the weekend but I'd like to be able to set a slightly later bedtime.   All round a good app and does what it says it does. Easy to set up and multiple adults can have access to control the kids accounts.",4

I love that I can view how much time they've used on certain apps and what they're currently using. I can also view what websites they've visited!  Love that I can block them from any apps and that I can just set it to block any new apps they download.  I can also limit time on certain apps and leave them with only educational ones or brain training ones.   Love the pause feature and free play mode too.  Customer service is fab and I highly recommend it any chance I get!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,A great app for keeping control of your child's screen time especially for younger kids. Love the summary and the idea of blocking any new apps. We can check age appropriate content before they start using them.,5

I have 1 question that will change this review from a 3 star from previous use... to possibly a 5 star... Can the current version control (or track) everything, especially including incognito mode?",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent app esp knowing the websites the children go to. The internet is a scary place so it's good to know where they are visiting. Older child hates it younger ones just accept.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This works so well for my kids that I started using it for our tablets at work. Keeps the users out of stuff that they should not use and stops them from installing unauthorized applications.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I REALLY wish it would work with our son's PC, too.  If the app did that, it'd be perfect.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app that works as advertised. Just one thing annoys me - if the application is stopped / killed whilst running - which sometimes happens when the app is in the background and energy savers decide to kill it - the app looses the login details so I have to sign in again. This is exceptionally annoying.  Also it would be great if I could give time to my kids which doesn't expire at midnight - this would allow the child to earn rewards during the week but not automatically force the child to use it the same day. Other than that this app is great - 5 stars if this could be fixed.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Was in beta but only reason I left beta was so I could leave feedback..... Love this app, my kids hate it but until they can control their device usage it's staying installed. The yearly charge is small for all the great features , I would like more granular control of apps for example set a limit to 30 mins only to Snapchat/YouTube whilst still taking from the daily limit. Also what would be good is how much data is being used / wifi and cellular and have a way to limit when data limit reached.......  Kids are ignoring the limit I set on the device manually. Thanks again",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is excellent for giving your kids limits with their screens! App is always being improved as well which is great! And the screen time team are so helpful and quick to respond to any questions. I highly recommend to all parents!!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I really liked the idea of it. I have an Android, also my kids. I was waiting for my free tryout to expire so by then I would have definitely get the premium version which I love! BUT with 2 more days left I started to have troubles with app. More than once I couldn't log into my account and then found out kids managed to uninstall it on their phones even though I had set up through the app to set a password to prevent that from happening. So now I'm left a bit disappointed and I am going to uninstall the app from my phone. Thank you though it was nice to see my kids actually want to do chores without complaining.",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Extremely painful app. Figuring out how to delete it took more than 10 mins because their instructions don't work. During the short amount of time the app was up and running it wasn't working. How this has 4 stars on google play is mind boggling. It only has 2 stars on the app store and that is 2 stars too many.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Has not worked far a few months but have no problem with automatic charge for another year,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love that I am in full control of my kids' tablets remotely. They sure do listen when I threaten to reduce the daily minutes to ZERO or to block an app until further notice. My kid even asked what task she can do to earn some extra time! I also like that they can't install an app without my knowledge.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app puts control back in my hands which is exactly what I was looking for. I can control what programs and apps they can and can't use, and when and for how long they can use them. It allows me to monitor their web history. My kids now gladly do homework and chores for time on the tablet. That alone makes paying for the subscription worthwhile! It has taken the fight and the fear out of my kid's use of technology.  LOVE IT!!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have been using this wonderful app for a few years now with my three teenagers.  It has been fantastic.  I like everything about it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Thank you for giving back... 100 % needed and unexpected great app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Daily summary good. Have to completely block google though bc kid can access other non-approved sites and the app only shows that google was accessed, not the actual site kid visited...i.e. youtube. This needs to be addressed.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Nice and easy control,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I am unable to create my account. Why?,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's great. I can set time limits and if my son wants more time he has task that needs to complete in order to have more time. Thi s way he is not just on the tablet. On the other hand if he is not listening them I can take time away too. He likes it as it teaches him self control with tv and computer apps,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It didn't work it' every time I what to open it it's just locks me out,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. It does everything it promises and very useful side functions. Customer service is also very helpful,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a fantastic app for keeping track of the apps on my kids' devices.   We fight over screen time much less because Screen Time can show the kids exactly how long they have been on.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The odd bug pops up from time to time but the team is pretty responsive to feedback and none of the issues I have come across are deal breakers. I find that the annual fee is very reasonable compared to all of the other apps I have tried. My kids really respond well to the tasks and complete them to earn more time. Great app, looking forward to seeing how it will improve further as time goes on.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Really useful to limit my childrens' excessive smartphone usage without having to start a discussion each day. Work very well so far and is easy to use.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Before the update i thiught this app was fantastic. It is easy to follow and setting daily limits and blocking your childs phone could be done at the touch of a button. But since putting my other daughters i phone onto the app its limitations to block her phone are driving me crazy. I have to create a schedule for entire time i have blocked her instead of being able to just turn it off and on. As i set schedules and turn them off i cannot create a different schedule if it overlaps with another even if neither are active. However a glitch is making this ten times harder because it will not load the schedules i have turned off to delete them... please change it back i loved the other version and that is the one i paid for not this.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app.  You can try free but they just dont do the job properly,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great job!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Have dropped stars atm as contact us not working and school blocker not working properly since last update.   Does what it says on the tin very useful have four girls under the age of ten have proved very useful. A warning that time is due to run out would be useful. We've have a couple of issues with our lenovo tablets but the lads and lasses on the Contact us are always very helpful and knowledgeable.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,When iOS will be turned to flight mode then no policy will be applied and Screen Time counter is also disabled. Should be easy to count it locally on the device. My 8yr old found out this kind of option on 5th day of usig the iPhone.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Just what we needed. Great features.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Screen time works great on Android and Fire OS from my experience. It's easy to use and I'm able to control the devices from my phone. The reason for only 4 stars is because there is a issue using with iPhone. I can only speculate that it's an issue with the VPN it uses with the profile through screen time that causes the app to lock then have to go through the app to unlock.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Would give it a full score but didn't use Google for payment.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love the free play feature, keeps the kids under control",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a fast easy way to manage my kids time on their tablet.  I schedule it so they have to do a few chores or homework before they can start and it ends at a specific time.  I can limit some apps and make the educational ones unlimited.  Awesome app!  Thanks!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Trying to access the parental controls and it won't let me, perhaps as my free trial ended and I didn't upgrade it. Was great while I was using it. Kids hated it, but now trying to lift restrictions and it's impossible",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Tried to set schedule but it will not load. Tried to use 'contact us' and that would not open open either. I would definitively purchase after free trial if I wasn't already having problems. Loved the concept.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has been a game changer in our household and caused a shift away from so much time on the phone.  The only thing that is a bummer is that letting some apps stay on at bedtime...doesn't work all the time.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Only on a trial but i love it used to dread bed time as my kids would always say just let me finish this game. Now i don't hear a peep. Thank you. I like the task mode..how about a sanction mode deduct time for rudeness etc  and display it on their screen time why they lost it.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app that allows you to monitor and control what your kids are doing on the devices.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works as advertised,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app! It's very easy to use and I can monitor everything my teenager does on her phone.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We installed this, and it has been great. Can pause play, creating a clear end to screen use. My kids were always saying. ""1 more minute!"" , and that always ended up being 20 more minutes.  Screen time allows us to set clear limits. Can always add time too. I like the new feature of Schedules. We can set off/on times and days to make sure the kids are getting their homework done during the week.Very useful tool for parents!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app makes life bearable for me...I love that I don't have to resort to idle threats.  I can shut her phone down or only allow certain apps set schedules and keep an eye on what she's looking at.  I have tried so many apps before this and it really was the best option.  Thank you screen time for making me a better parent.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Excellent app to manage children's screen time, and there's the flexibility of giving them free play or pause their play when required.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Could we have the ""Pause for x minutes"" feature back? That was really useful to get the kid away from the device amd have it come back to an unlocked one after the chore. Apart from that, this app does exactly what it should and the developers listen to suggestions (they could actually improve around annoucing improvements... for the longest of times, I did not know the school day times had become customizable per day). Hardly use it these days for more than manually locking/unlocking, but it's a lot more powerful than that.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to use! Great app!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a single mom of 3 kids I thought screen time would be helpfull, I was wrong. This app is very glitchy which makes a lot of extra work for me. It randomly takes my kids apps away at times when it's not supposed to. The workers are also very rude, they are reluctant to help me when I have questions and they say mean things to me when I don't understand their help. One of them even called me dumb. I am very disappointed in their attatuid. I would also like to adress the extreme glitchyness of screen time. Screen time will disapear and log me out making it impossible to veiw my kids activity. It is a very timely process trying to get back in. Its also almost imposible for me as a PARENT to get rid of this app which makes screen time more of a virus than a moniter. So in all I encourage all parents to not get this app it is an utter waist of time",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has saved my family sanity.  A single app that can easily control my kids devices and shut them off when they need to do something or have just become overly grouchy.  Their devices are so hard to control and this has made it easy.  Fantastic!  Recommended to me by a friend and now I recommend to all of my friends who are having similar problems with kids and electronics.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is an amazing app that gives me total control of all of my kids devices regardless of where I am! I can always see if the device is on or off and what app is being used. I can set the amount of time each kid can use their device, what apps can be used, fhe hours the device can be used and even completely block the device from being used with one tap. The app is super easy to use and setup too! I would highly recommend this app to any parent looking for a good parental control app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great tool for sensible parents.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Very good app. I never thought I'd pay for the subscription, but I did and I'm glad. Well worth it, all arguments over tablet time with my 7 year old are over.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Thanking God for this app! I'm an adult, but I put this app on my own phone to help me stay off the internet when I should be sleeping at night. It's perfect! When I set it up, I simply put on the restrictions that I wanted, then asked my mom to keep the password for me. It has worked great, and has not given me any trouble that I can think of. It's well worth a few dollars, especially since it's so customizable.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Does the job very well, and even my parenting friends ""get it"" around the dinner table. An absolute must these days if you care to care about how your children grow up. I filter access/content via the router at home, but with ScreenTime I can ration the actual device usage, wherever my kids are. The best bit? My 11 year old  and my 8 year old accept the ""why"" about why we do this (grudgingly...). The app just facilitates the ""how"". Very well done, all at ScreenTime, you get my full 5 stars!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We lost our daughter when we bought her her first smartphone. She became moody and withdrawn. We tried taking her phone of her at set times in the day and the night only to catch her sneaking down to find it in the middle if the night. It was scary and stressful. Screentime allows us to easily control her access. There is no room for argument about how long she has or hasn't used her phone for and best of all, she is smiling and talking to us again. Cannot recommend this app enough to parents of kids who struggle with electronic devices.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love that I have complete control over what my kids can view (much to their annoyance!!), but it leaves me safe in the knowledge that they can't access anything that could lead to anything untoward. Absolutely worth the subscription for complete peace of mind.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very useful app for parents with growing kids.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I LOVE this app! So worth the money and does so many things that you just can't get from other similar apps. Which is why I'm so disappointed that it's having such difficulty dealing with the new Kindle Fire 7th gen. I have it installed on both my kids' new Kindles, which worked okay for a day or two, but the it began spazzing out blocking things I previously unblocked or not blocking apps during schduled times that games were off and reading was on. I really, REALLY would hate to have to find another app with less features and cancel my subscription, so I hope I can maybe get some sort of solution to this issue.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love the app. Just wish it also had a tracker on it as well. Other then that it works great for our needs.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is very easy to navigate. My children (15, 11, 8) have been very cooperative and understanding as we have set limits on their devices. This app is a good tool for both parents and kids to have balance in the way they spend their time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Simple to use. Wish I installed it sooner.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The most lovely are the tasks!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've had this app installed on my triplets' phones for close to a year, and have very few complaints. Recently, they figured out a way to disable ScreenTime completely! (I'm not posting how they did it bc I don't want other kids to see!) The developer didn't have a solution to fix it, just said they would work on it. In order for me to keep my boys from disabling ScreenTime, I've had to go in and block access to the Settings on each of their phones.   I'll give this app 4 stars if they can get that problem fixed, and 5 stars if they can ever get the web search/history feature to work!  Also, like another user suggested, I would love to be able to put specific time limits on certain apps. On weekends, I let my boys have 1 1/2 hours, and they spend the majority of the time watching YouTube. It would be nice if I could limit that down!",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Kids hated, parents approved.  Great app and the kids actually do appreciate having a tool that helps them control screen time addictions.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have been using this app for over 2 years and I absolutely loved it up until recently. As of right now my daughter is completely locked out of her tablet and I cannot get into it either.   I had blocked settings on her tablets. Somehow, she disconnected herself from the Internet. Now I can't get in to the tablet at all. The password that I enter is invalid and I can't reset it because she's not able to connect to the internet.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,i like that i can see what my kids are doing on their tablets. it's easy to use.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love it now when I tell my kids to do something I only ask once because they know if they don't listen i pause there tablet.  I can even pause it when I'm not home if they are giving grandpa a bad time in the morning when getting ready for school. Totally love this app.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It seriously helped in studies,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Saves my sanity! Great app which gives me control over my daughter's cell phone usage. Definitely worth the pro version!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I can't believe I am paying a monthly fee for this app, but after trying many other free apps, Screen Time is leaps and bounds above the rest.  It's so easy to monitor what my kids are doing from the parent app on my phone.  I LOVE the pause feature and the ability to block certain apps.  Overall, I am very pleased with performance and ease of use with this app.  My only recommendations are these: 1) I wish I could set a time limit on a specific app - only 15 minutes of youtube or 30 minutes of Minecraft, etc.  2) Customize notifications from the program -- daily I get a ton of notification emails from screen time.  I wish I could elect to pare these down.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app with lots of control.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Fantastic app for parents who want to moderate and monitor their children's phone and tablet use. Love the ability to add my own schedules now.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It works great and is pretty user friendly. I can create tasks for my daughter to do to earn extra time. The only thing is my daughter doesn't like it to much because I can control her tablet time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is an amazing app and every parent should install.  It allows me to control exactly how my kids are using their devices.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is exactly what I was looking for. I love the control it allows across multiple devices. I've also been very pleased with the technical support.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app so far! It's easy to use, fair, and I love that it is so detailed giving minute to minute updates on what your kids are doing on their phone if you look at the app. I have only used it for a few weeks but nothing bad to say so far!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Very good app. Love how is shows everything in past history, and recently used. Use this app everyday.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very useful and easy to use.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent app and still improving. Cuts out most of the arguments over screen time while allowing flexibility and gives me peace of mind that my son can't buy or fiddle with anything anything he shouldn't.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Didn't work.. My child was able to uninstall and reinstall so it wouldn't block the apps.. Also the apk download... No good.  They make it hard to get your money back,2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I really like this app and have recommended it to several friends.  However some glitches have arisen recently that are a nuisance and so I couldn't give the 5 stars that I would have given otherwise. Hopefully I'll be sorted soon. And my recommendation stand.  This is a great app!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Make the notification optional. Ok,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app to monitor your child's device activities.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is really good app if you want to have a control what your kid is doing on its device. One thing that i'm missing is some kind of parent app whitelist. It is possible to temporary unlock app, but it is for a short time period.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,this app is terrible! I do not want to stalk my child?!?!?!?!??,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"So far so excellent, it updates me of the children's usage when I'm busy working so I can see that they are being sensible. I reward them with extra time for great reading or helping with the house. They are both very responsive to this, ages 10 and 7,using analogue Samsung tablets",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app! I wish I would have found this a year ago! This does everything I needed for monitoring my boys' screen time. I love creating tasks that they have to complete in order to earn more time. Then, they click on their app & let me know the task is complete. I plan on subscribing after my trial is up. Super happy with this one so far.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Been a subscribed user for several months and held off too long on a review. The app is amazing and versatile.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is amazing for parents. All parents should install it! I love that I can track and set a time limit for how long my kids are on their electronics. Tracking their history and app usage is great too. Being able to pause it whenever I need too is an awesome bonus. I can't say enough good things about this app. It has stopped all the fighting between is and our kids. We set a limit, they know about it, and I don't have to yell at them to get off. Total game changer.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I HATE THIS APP!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a very useful app for parents but it's very expensive. It was somewhat useful in the free version but it's now completely useless...   You have to go premium (which is OK for me and did for the last 3 years) but it's not a one time purchase, it's a subscription. For one year it's 40 USD which is too much for me... I'm searching for alternatives...",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good app for monitoring they way your child uses a device.. I've only used for phone,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Just what I wanted for my kids. I am in full control and the just accept the limitation they now have on their devices. Perfect.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app, easy to use. One feature that can be improved is to name the two apps for parents and children so it is clear, which is which.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Installed the app on all the kids devices and shortly there after they had disabled it and still use the devices after bedtime...waste of time on my part.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app helps me keep the kids from accessing apps they really shouldn't. Thanks.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Overall it's working ok for our preteen. I can limit usage and see what apps are being used. I wish it also allowed me to see my son's web history, I keep waiting for an update to add this.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app! Gives my child freedom to use her tablet but allows me to keep on eye on her content.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I've used this app for one year now. It is great and does what it claims to do. Easy to communicate with also.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"A really good app, makes it easier to control the activity of the kids on their mobile phone. The family gained a lot since installing it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is very effective in maintaining parental control over what kids are doing online. Worth every penny!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My daughter was able to delete the app on her tablet even though I set a password.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have been using this app for 7 odd days. Its really easy to use. Being able to pause kid screens from my phone is a great feature. It makes it really easy to get them to mealtimes particularly. We just dont have endless conversations and negotiations. Being able to approve apps before they get installed on children's devices is great too. Overall, I think this has made it possible for me to let the kids have devices. Because I can set up reasonable boundaries. My only problem with it is that it is somewhat clunky on my phone - and the screen hangs sometimes when switching between kids. But that may be my phone rather than the app. Highly recommend this.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app I would recommend to any parent.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app because it easy to use and once there time is up its and cuts them off irs work every penny if you want to mobitor your kids time on the devices,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Okay,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best app for monitoring what your kids are doing. There has been no fights when his time is up since the app automatically stops him from doing more. He's highly motivated by the tasks to gain more screen time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My kid is upset because I blocked certain apps, including the Android app store. I think this app is amazing, since I can block specific things, such as the app store and internet. I'm not worried about bypassing cell restrictions because there's nothing to access with! I'd like to have more detailed information and pull screen shots from the phone and have GPS, but those are just a few things I'd like added for a subscription.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Does nothing useful in terms of limiting screen time unless you pay for premium version, this is NOT a free app.  Update: Upgraded to five stars. It works well, and is the only solution I could find that works both on Android AND Amazon Fire tablets. Everything can be controlled from either your phone or desktop (using the Screentime website). It's worth the price to keep kids from abusing video on their devices. I don't think most people have a problem paying for quality solutions, I was just squawking because the limitations of the free app are not clearly disclosed.  Conclusion: just pay for the app; you'll save yourself a lot of grief, and the kids will be better off, even though they may not recognize that for a long time. Meanwhile, committed developers need to be compensated for their efforts. So I think it works out for everyone.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Just stole my money,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My kids were unhappy when I installed this on their phones but as a parent, this app is brilliant! I had already told my kids I could see everything they do and post in the internet...now I almost can!

I'm still on the free 14 day trial, but I am seriously considering purchasing after the trial period is up.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It didn't accumulate times across screens, which seemed odd. Also, my child was not able to bank time for a later date. So she felt compelled to use up her screen time on a daily basis.if those things don't bother you, it's a fine and easy apple to use. Install and uninstall were easy. And in all fairness, we tried it for just a few days, maybe we missed a setting and the things we thought the app didn't do were just settings we didn't find.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have been using this app for almost two years. I keep waiting for it to be available for use on their laptops as well. So far no luck.

I think it is time to move on to something that covers all of the electronic devices they have.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's the best parental control app out there. The only reason I have it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it doesn't work well with iOS.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've put this up to 4 stars as the free play function has been brought back, and it is back to being a very good product. The last star is held because this mess should never have happened and I'm not convinced it won't happen again. We had contact with Screen Time several months ago querying how free play worked with remaining daily limit and were told that's how most users want it, and I remember being unconvinced. This latest episode shows that Screen Time desperately need to do some research in to how their product is actually used, as they clearly have no clue. I hope that they do this and that future developments are in the right direction.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent app to monitor and allocation screen time for your kids.   This is the perfect app for our family with the free play mode allowing us to be flexible with the unknowns of each and every day.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've restored the five star rating for the quick response on the free play button issue. Thank you for hearing us!! Previous review: Very disappointed with the latest update. I have changed my rating from five stars to one. Free play is gone which is the feature we used most. And it was done without warning, during winter break when it is needed the most. Keep in mind this app is not just used by parents of high schoolers. Elementary school children will not respond to schedules like this. I really don't want to search for another app, so please bring free play back or I won't be renewing. Original review---This app has changed our lives. My kid was getting angry and difficult because of her tablet use. She was frustrated herself but would not listen to me telling her to get off of it.This solved most of the problems. The pause button combined with limits and rewarding chores with extra time=brilliant!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app. Kids hate it! Glad the free play is back.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Top notch app.  Real world features. In the last 3 years, never had any issues. Thank you.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great product until you need support,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Thank you for listening and putting the free play mode back in, especially in such quick order!  Back to 5 stars for screentime labs!---Updating 5 to 1 star after latest update.  As others have said, the Free Time Mode functionality needs to be added back in.   We use this all the time! Otherwise I will have to look for a new app which I would prefer not having to do.  ---Original Review---   By far the best parent control app for devices and kids.  Developers continue to make significant and usable enhancements and fixes.  I recommend to every fellow parent when the topic of protecting your kids online comes up.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It would be perfect but sadly key functionality not their to make me buy it plzzz fix the following: 1- not all the workd has Sat and Sun off you know 2- school time may differ from weekend as some schools have different schedule so i need to choose the off days 3- very disappointing that websites blocking isn't there 4- must have screen time per app or group of apps other competitor apps have this feature  Thanks for the other wonderful features,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,A credit to the developer. People wanted a removed feature brought back. Took awhile for them to finally respond but they did. 3 product is a 4 but poor response from negative feedback gets a 3. For what you pay for the service that should be better..  Since the update I am not happy with those of some features. Not going to renew. The loss of the free time mode was the biggest mistake they made,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"At first the kids resisted, but now they are grateful and tell me they want to use the app when their kids get phones.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Thank you for bringing back the Free Play Mode.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Because you made dumb changes suddenly and tried to sell them as ""enhancements"".  Yes the free play button. Never do that again. You must wow me to return to 5 now.  This app ain't cheap.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,EDIT: Good to see the people at Screen Time are so quick to respond. Thank you for listening to us parents and bringing back the Free Time button. Happy customer once again.  👍,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Thank you for bringing back the free play button! I love the app, but hated when they took away the free play button. It is back now, so easy to use to reward my kid & allow him to stay up a little longer when school is out without completely changing settings.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Free Play Mode is back. Thanks for listening to your customers. Previous review: The latest update removes the most used and valued feature. This company's response over on Facebook:  ""yes we removed Free Play Mode as it didn't seem to be needed anymore now that we have the new Schedules feature.""  Well now this entire app doesn't seem to be needed.   The holidays are here - family schedules are out the window, and so is this service without the functionality of Free Play Mode.   The ownership group of Screentime Labs has precious time to figure out how to undo the damage done. Again, families need this kind of control service over the holidays, and with Screentime now effectively useless for our needs the holidays grant us more than the normal amount of time (and motivation) to look for alternatives. In between enabling and disabling schedules, that is.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great tool in managing the time and use for our children. Moreover they listen very well to feedback (recently the function free play time has been added back within 1 day after user feedback).,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Thank you for bringing us back the freeplay button,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"UPDATE: back to 5 stars. Thank you for listening to everyone's feedback and bringing ""free time""  back quickly.   Old: And with this update i can no longer add ""free time"" without changing the settings itelf.. where did my easy add time go? What if I'm in the car 30 min past bedtime and want to give them ONLY 30min? No... I have to turn off the settings and remember to turn them back on myself in 30. You say ""free time"" was no longer needed. I used that more then anything else in that app and clearly a lot of other people used it as well. Frankly, I'm going to stop being a paid user if it doesn't come back and quickly. You removed half of the reason I agreed to pay.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Thank you for bringing back free play mode! It's nice to know you're listening to your customers.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Edited because Free Play Mode is back! Thank you!!! I bought this app specifically to grant my child time now and then. They removed the Free Play Mode in the last update and now it's just about worthless to me.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Wonderful app and developer is fast to respond and fix issues. Best parental control software we've ever used.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Updated 23/12: Fab free play is back.  Very quick response from the developers.  Couldn't be happier with the app. Will continue to recommend to everyone with children! Previous review 21/12: Bring back free play mode!  Have paid for the premium service for well over a year.  Will definitely be cancelling this if it is not restored. The new schedules is complicated and unnecessary. If you click to cancel the schedule then the time still counts towards daily limit.  So you need to extend this too - extra steps for the parent which you then need to go back and cancel.   I have been extremely happy with this app until the most recent update.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Its Brilliant,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Thank you for putting free play back on...,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"12/23 review: Screen Time Labs has responded to the mob of angry parents and brought back Free Play in time for the school holidays. Thank you!! That is great customer service and deserves some loyalty. Now just don't touch our other favorite stuff and we'll be golden! :-)  12/22 unhappy review (edited for brevity): Happy subscriber until the latest update. Without Free Play mode, I can't use this app. It will have to go unless you can fix it in a day or two.  Original review: My kids would just play all day and all night without this. I can set limits,  control when they can use certain apps,  and send ""5 minute warning""  type messages. Really useful, no complaints at all.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love that you guys listen to your consumers!!! Back to being the best parental control app around!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app provides what other big competitors like phonesheriff and qustodio have failed to do - control how much time is allowed overall AND control which apps are included in this limit. So I can limit games and smth else, but calls won't be blocked. It will be nice to have geofencing and sos button, but these features are not very critical and there are plenty alternatives for that including web filtering... And the greatest and, I think, unique feature - to give bonuses for competed tasks.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"One star right back to five star, thank you so much for bring back free play. I love the schedule feature. This is the best app on my phone. It allows my child's phone to work for me not against me. Any parent worried about the affect giving a child a phone just needs this app. Wonderful.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Update: These guys listened and brought back Free Play Mode in 23Dec2017 update. So they are back to 4*.  Previously: I searched high and low for the Free Play mode. Wondering if I'm missing something. So disappointed with the new update. Free Play allowed me to give the kids a given time to play, and I don't need to monitor them as it will auto blue screen when the time is up. Or when the kid wants to search for something on his phone and I can just give him 5min immediately with a quick tap. Schedules is a nice touch, it has its benefits, I can see a time set for ""homework"" as being useful. But it cannot replace Free Play mode. I am paying for this app. The only app on my phone which I'm willing to pay for. Bring back Free Play Mode or I'll pay some other app which can meet my needs.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Update: FREE PLAY is back! Thank you for listening to our concerns. You all worked very fast with the update. I love thw app again. Thank you!

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The app before the update was great would have given it 5 as you could give them additional free time but for some reason they have taken away a key feature that we used everyday. Pleae put it back otherwise will have to look for a new app,1

The one major drawback I have run into is the password on her device. We travel a lot and I can't remember her password to get into the settings on her device. I want to turn her WiFi on but can't without her personal password. I allowed it from my device but without internet on hers, it never got the signal. I can't retrieve her password without internet on her device. It would be nice if we could retrieve the password via the adult's device.",4

It also has a free play and pause button for exceptional days that don't follow the norm,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Parent here:  parents NEED controls for school issued Chromebooks, assp! personal devices the kids are able to figure out ways to circumvent the controls, quicker than we can keep up with their backdoor usage. I find this app better than any I've tried including Norton, the developers are very helpful, great customer service (5 star). As of now, im on my kids phone, again he managed to outsmart me and this app. I would like to see improvements with tracking (reviewing) sms  messages, as many msgs were from unk sources, quite frankly the pervs are in abundance when kids have access to apps thought to be kid friendly, yet location services are turned on by default through the third party apps. The one caveat is pausing, they come from their hiding spots because their access was cut...then they go to unmonitored Chromebooks. Another plus is the app is cross device compatible, except for Chromebooks. It's imperative that parents know who is texting their kids and the substance of the messages. Kids truly don't understand the extreme dangers and will reply then giving their isp. Also camera and microphone filters.",4

Definitely helps to get him on board with school work now that he realizes he can't just put it off. The tasks to allow more time are a great feature. Only change I would like is a bit more leeway in changing the days the regular times you can select for when the kids time is being allotted and used. (Example would be to allow Friday to be considered the weekend, so he can have more time that day, instead of breaking it up Monday-Friday and the weekend separate. As it stands, after school Friday I just give him free time all day, similar to what I let him do all weekend, would be nice if I could do that automatically instead of having to manually do that every Friday)",5

Be aware though that you only get the full use of the app for 2 weeks then you have to pay for the premium version. We felt it was worth every penny in our house to upgrade so went ahead.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It works well. You don't know that you download the premium version and has a trial period. If we end up having to pay, we'll fins different app. If you have a smartphone, it will sync with your child's tablet.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Greate app, works well.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I liked it, but they won't except my credit card for the subscription.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great way to control kids tech time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app to stop the kids over doing it on their android & ios devices. Can control what apps to allow too like educational ones after their fun time is over.  Love the tasks they can do to gain more time,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Awesome app that enables you to control what the kids can see and do on their phones. A real eye opener as to what they use their phones for and for how many hours per day. It's not about having 'control' but being able to guide them and help them at a young age. I had a question and the developer responded within an hour or so. Amazing app, great support.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It has helped a lot with getting my daughter to put the tablet down and doing what needs to be done,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I like using this with my son. I think it's important to talk about it with him before using however,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"All the general issues faced by parents of teenagers, are taken care of in this application.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I am the one that has it on their phone. I think that it works well but my main gripe is that it does not give you very clear warnings and when the time is up you are unable to quickly add another minute or two as a child. Good for the parents and I do not mind it that much,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I'm pretty mad about this app. The tablet is sitting under the christmas tree,  she hasn't even been able to use it yet, and already all of the functions i needed for her,  are disabled because just about everything on here is a ""premium"" function. All i want is to be able to control bed time so she can't sneak onto it.  But no.  I have to pay for that too. And right now its just something i cannot afford.  They gave no indications as to how long the trial period would be.  Just all of a sudden its all disabled. Very rude.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is an OKAY app. And this is me, a teenager speaking. The one problem is with my mother and me is: What is split screen? I am a YouTuber, and when I try to comment on YouTube, it says: ""Sorry# You cant use split screen!"" Both me and my mother don't know what this is. How does she disable it?",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"5 stars if it didn't occasionally freeze the kid's tablets after we unpaused them.  The only people who won't like this app and the companion app is children who misbehave more than they should, think everything should be handed to them and that they do not have to earn anything!  Real life is YOU WORK, YOU EARN!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Im 17 and my parents downloaded this to my phone. The problem i have with it is that when i try to copy anything on discord, it pops up, sorry you cant use split screen. I cabt even edit any spelling errors because of the pop up.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We discussed the rules clearly with my son. The app helps a lot to get the homework and learning done in time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's very easy to use. I love the ability to monitor my daughter's phone usage. She been given a daily limit and when she reaches that limit she has to do extra chores or tasks to earn more time. If she is back talking or getting in trouble I love the advantage of getting to pause time at the push of a button. She's not happy with it but as a parent I LOVE it!!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app helps me keep the kids from doing something stupid. We habe custody of my niece. Facebook and instagram are a big part of bullying in school so this takes that out. Also with ADHD, keeping her focus off her phone and on homework is a big help.",5

It has a few issues with Xiaomi phones like - I have just locked her phone and I hear her speaks on the phone 🙄. Actually it didn't happen before but I see now that it stopped working  Everytime my kid installs something i get an alert. Very good.  I would like to have Hebrew support so my daughter can use the chores/tasks feature.   On the other hand it upsets me that everything is under premium version with is not cheap. Some features should be free.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,good,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It makes them feel like they are made to follow even more rules then they can hold. They start school at two difrent times once a week 9 00 and four times a week 8 15 and they are to tierd for school if there not on ther phones for 30min. At nine they cant be on there phones becaus of the school blocker so there so tierd at school.     Thanks screen time for making our lifes so sad,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app to limit your kids screen time. Really easy to use and help you keep track on all the apps your kid downloads and also the easiest way to limit what they can download and use. The daily summaries are excellent way to see what apps your kid has been using. Easy to give extra time if needed. Just perfect app for us!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Really like the school time ability to block certain apps.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The only app I have ever paid for! Now my children ask to do chores around the house. We have been through many apps before this one and it is by far the best one out there!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is great! I love that I can guide my daughter from a distance farther than worry about crazy things she may run into I the internet or elsewhere. This app ensures that my daughter's phone is safe. The only problem I had was when trying to set some of the time limits. It's easy to use but I'm not sure I understand how some features work. I guess I need to read the guide. Overall I love the app though,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Gorgeous app !,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Excellent app. The arguments have stopped, the children are doing their chores to win extra time, we know what the kids are up to and device usage is under control. I think this is an essential app for all parents and we run it three devices in the house.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,How do i terminate my account? I uninstalled the app on both my phone and my child's phone but it still locks my child's phone.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's the worst,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have installed the app on my son's phone. He was able to disable other Device limiting apps by going into the settings of his phone and force stopping and disabling apps. So be aware that other apps to limit  a phone will still allow you to go into the settings mode of a phone. This app prevents that. I highly recommended especially if you have a tech savvy child. The one thing I would highly recommend is that the company let you know ahead of time about this ability.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is amazing!! Realy easy to use. Solved a lot of issues in our house!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best app ever!! True parenting!! A God sent!! Thank you to the creators and visionaries of this app 👏👏👏 P.S. The support team is the best!! There is no problem they can't help you fix!!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My kid hates it therefore I love it....any chance I get to piss him off I'm all over it!.....its called ""don't get mad get even"".....I really dig that you can send a message to them when you shut their device down....i really have fun with this....the initial scream i hear when the device shuts off is usually always surpassed by what I hear when the message is read.....justice for all parents!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Been using the app for several months.  Instantly able to change and regulate our 11yr olds cell phone use.  Task completions really help encourage more time and easy to send.  Easy to block apps that kids dont need to have access to. Great app,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best thing ever.  Stops a lot of arguments because it sets the limits and everyone knows what they are.  I also like that I can see what apps and Web searches my kids are doing. My son went on the screen time app that controls the children's phone and rated it a 1! It frustrates him that we can see every app he downloads!!! 😂,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I hate this because my father has full control over everything I do, including the ability to read my messages to people, to seeing what I look up on the internet or YouTube. I'm 15 but my father still thinks I am not capable of managing my time by myself, which I am. This app has too much control and should be lowered.",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Its a great app. I can see details of what girls using. I dont restrict the time ..they dont know i see everything from my phone.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This applicatipn is BEST creation since Internet was created!! I have recommended this app to several parents and they also love it.  There is nothing in the world better than having control of what your child is doing and watching while on the endless world of technology!!! Best feature...you can ""STOP/PAUSE"" ON REAL TIME, if they are not doing what they are supposed to be doing.  It's our responsibility as parents to make sure that our kids are safe via the web and to have control of what they can see, hear, play via the web!!10 STARS FOR THIS APP.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Been using this app for a good while, and it met our house's needs. But now all it does is show the amount of time spent on the device... if I want to set any limits at all it wants me subscribe monthly. What is that about? I was never offered an option to do a one-time upgrade or anything. on the hunt for a new screen limiting app!",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has changed the playing field entirely. There has been no more fighting or whining as the expectations are set and followed! Very easy to set up and use. Totally worth the small cost.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"User friendly, helps kids understand their addiction",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app but my main flaw with it is I can't set times for individual days. It's mon-fri and weekends. Friday has to have same time as Monday. I would like option of setting different times for different says.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I find it very useful.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Our son has Oppositional Defiance Disorder and getting him to stop screen time to do other things was a constant battle.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to limit the time kids use their smartphone and super control of which apps they use and how long. Glad I found this app!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app works really well on my childrens Android and Kindle devices but it deactivates almost daily on my child's iPod. Also when I get daily summary emails it tells me that she only used 2 mins of her daily allocation. She told me that she used it for approx 40mins (??!?) I have uninstalled and followed instructions to reinstall several times now. I wouldn't recommend for iOS devices at this point. I would love a proper final solution.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"3 stars. Like the idea of this kind of control and rewards but the glitches are frustrating. Kids think I'm locking them out when I'm not. Updated to 2 stars and cancelled subscription. Confirmed they are not swiping closed the app. Maybe the battery saver is killing the app? I don't know, but it doesn't work when it's supposed to.

Kids may not quite like the app because it IS so good at monitoring them!  It's the best I've found out there.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Doesn't work. I put it on my daughter's phone yesterday morning. When I checked it at work it said she had only used it for 10 mins the entire day and she was using her phone when I got home from work. I evened tried pausing it and nothing happened. She has an iPhone and I have Android. I guess I will be looking for a different app.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,works great android to android.  I bought my daughters iphones and I have a galaxy 8.  there have been issues even after i removed the android version and downloaded the iphone app for their phones.  I hope all bugs have been worked out,3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Overall it's a great app. Has all the features I want to monitor and manage my teenager's phone and makes a great behavior management tool. My only and biggest complaint is that it drained my son's iPhone battery very quickly that I had to delete it and stop using it.

It sort of defeated the point of drawing away your attention from your phone. I deleted it quickly since the repeating notifications were getting irritating but they haven't stopped. I don't know if it was a virus that came with it or whether the app did sometime (it asks for lots of access to your settings) but now my phone is stuck like this. Not impressed.",3

My son loves the 'task' section; he can earn extra screen time by completing a variety of tasks I have set up, ie mow lawn for extra 20mins etc. I also like the 'pause' and 'play' functions. These allow parents to instantly pause screentime, eg for meals, or allow extra play time for going on long car journey etc without having to spend ages altering the main settings.

They're now more motivated to help around house, and I have complete control over what apps they use & when. Only complaint is the app is laggy when I'm swiping between kids.

I want Play Store blocked continuously, but the phone and text app always accessible.  I am not confident my son will have the capability to call when it is urgent.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Absolutely LOVE it! Wasn't crazy about the subscription part at first, but well worth it. I especially love the added ""task creation."" As a children's therapist, and a father, the ability to regulate the amount of time, while simultaneously skirting specific apps to run constantly, is not matched by any other program. In my home, my children are asked to do individual Bible study; I love that I can block everything, except the Bible app for that specified period of time. I'm addition, the ""pause"" feature is nice, because during my work day (I get home after they have already been home), I can pause them, and send them messages of encouragement and love, and then unpause and get back to my work day.   One small note: I do wish I could regulate each device's time individually. For example, my eldest has 2 devices; I wish there was a way to make the 2 hour limit control both devices, instead of 2 hours for each device. That's the only request (won't even call that a critique)!  Excellent app!",5

A few time, after I unlocked the phone, my kid's phone was still lock, but I can temporarily unlock at my kid's device using my password.

Thank you for restoring my sanity!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app allows you to see all the apps that your child has been using on his/her device, as well as the web searches.   You initially try the Premium feature which allows you to block the tablet after a certain amount of time that you, the parent, decide, Mon-Fri/Sat-Sun can have different times. There are also Bedtime blockers and school time blockers, where you can chose which apps the child can use at any time.   Once your Premium offer has finished, all these blockers are disabled and you are left with only the option to see what your child is using, with no blockers. You can go Premium for £29.99 a year (almost the price of an antivirus), which in my opinion, as the mother of an 8 year old child, is too expensive.   I can verbally ask my child to stop using the tablet and she will usually listen to me. I guess it is ok for teenagers, but I think that if you teach a little bit of common sense to your child, you won't need all these blockers, since your child should know when it's time to stop. It is good for your information though, as you get to see what apps your child uses the most, but definitely not worth £29.99 a year.",3

All these kids on here saying the app's ""broken your family"" and you've no control over your life, well (a) if it takes this show of responsibility by your parents to install the app and 'control' your use then the family was already broken and (b) if you've lost personal control of games and other apps as the result of 'Screen Time's then there in itself is the reason your parents installed it in the first place.

It worked decent on one of my kids Samsung but the two older kids  that have APPLE phones were a nightmare.  I did my research and read the reviews about APPLE iPhones and how it didn't work with them but didn't believe it. It literally would lock up my kid's iPhones and then when they couldn't get it back they would be missing all their up apps sometimes for up to an hour. Thankfully they weren't in an emergency situation. Also, you must be somewhere that has wifi too to regain it.  This company has the right idea but has introduced it too prematurely before doing enough testing and getting these important issues fixed.  I will probably get a response from them about ""did you contact us to discuss these issues"" and the answer is that I tried too but the contact tab or chat option was always down.  I went to the FAQS AND it just told me what I already knew about the iPhones being reset or locked out. It's a shame but Maybe once they lose enough customers they will get things fixed with Apple products and reintroduce  the program.  As for now, do not get this.",1

Otherwise I find the app is really good, it's interesting to see what my children spend their time doing when they're on their phones and I love being able to pause them when it's dinner time",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app.  Exactly what we needed!  Kids respect their time on their tablets now and spend a lot more time outside!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Nope,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's fairly easy to use, and seems to do the trick when I need the kids to get off their devices and get working. I do find that the time of use on some isn't accurate. For example, I know my son wastxhed more than 1 hour of You Tube one day, because we were watching together for at least 2 hours on a long drive. Yet Screen Time didn't report the full time. Other than that in quite pleased with it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"At first it was heaven sent!  24hrs later it kept taking ALL the apps off his iPad. 5 days later my sons tablet wouldn't unpause!

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent app. I have tried many apps and this is the best i found. To prevent uninstallation i had to restrict access to settings. My kid is able to run music in off time as the restriction message from this app takes a second to appear. But i am ok with this. Otherwise his phone is under my complete control. I love this app. It has taught my kid the value of time as he is now carefully using the phone due to limited time available.,5

Now we've agreed that I can pause his phone and message him when I need him to either do something or be present. I think there's a big trust issue here though. My son was worried I'd be using it to violate his privacy. So, I made him promises about what I would and would not be using it for. Kids still need some independent and privacy, and this is a great tool to manage that. But I can see how some parents might abuse the app to restrict their child in possibly unfair ways. It's much more useful to get your child on board with it. Less headaches and upset in the long run.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Found this to be a horrid con.  A ""free"" app for child safety.  All I wanted was something to restrict my child's daily use of the device.  Installs ok, but then you have to add the companion app, and then set up an account for yourself.  And then, finally, you get to the time settings - you are now informed this is a ""premium feature"" and will be charged, but they STILL don't tell you how much this will be. Looked it up, and it's 3.50 a MONTH!  Are you kidding me?  Couldn't uninstall it fast enough....",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It was awesome in the beginning  when I first got it. Kids hated it but I loved it.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I like this app. My daughter doesn't like the bedtime blocks. Doesn't matter cause I LOVE IT. I hope they will fix some things like not being able to work with Marshmallow or Nougat systems. Would like GPS tracker as well since we have lost the phone before.  Otherwise great app.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Excellent App. This app has really helped bring screen use under control in our household. I love the fact that it helps them see how much time they use and that they can gain extra time by doing other tasks (like their music practice and Duolingo!) It doesn't work so well on iPhone (you can't get access to some apps and not others once time is up) though I know that's not the developer's fault. It's worth introducing it carefully - perhaps try a period where you don't have time limits first to show them how much time they really are using! It has the potential to cause a lot of arguments, but we worked with the kids on it - empathy needed! - and they are gradually coming to accept it. They have even started coming to spend time with us and socialise!!! :-)",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is very simple and it allows the parent to remain in charge during these very crucial years of development. You can have as much or as little control as you want and you can remain partners.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Don't waste your money. A buggy app that make the device unworkable after losing WiFi and cellular connection. The iOS is particularly not useful   because you can only block (or track) all the app of the device together.,2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great way to keep track of time my daughter spends on her phone and which apps she can download.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Use on nexus and hudel2. The kids even love the app too. Great 'task' functionality too where kids can earn tablet time. All those little jobs they never did before get done without argument so they can earn 5 minutes extra time. Would be better if task time could be allocated to a day of parents/kids choice or even a reserve pool for use within month for the going to bed without argument tasks we set! Try the free trial and see if it works for you and your kids. Works well for us.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This this app is really useful for monitoring what my kids doing and for making sure that they are not on inappropriate sites. The fact that so many kids have given one star means they're doing something right,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app! Easy to use and my child is happy to accept his new boundaries. The task function is clever too. Happy to upgrade to premium. The trial was awesome and ad free. What a pleasure!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We have been using this App for the last few weeks, and we're finding that it pretty much meets all our requirements. Our main reason for using this App is to limit our kids' use of their tablets. When verbally giving the kids a time limit, we found that we'd often get distracted, & not notice when they'd exceeded the limits. Obviously they wouldn't remind us! This App means this can no longer happen. The kids enjoy being rewarded for completing tasks, so we get the bonus of them helping out more! The only feature I'd like to see in future, is the ability to save task reward time, rather than having to use it on the same day as tasks are completed. Some of the tasks our kids complete are ones that they do later in the evening. The problem is that they sometimes get rewarded with additional time, but then it reaches their Bed Blocked time, and they are unable to use the additional time they gained. It'd be nice if they could carry this time forward. Otherwise, I can see the kids realising that there's no gain in doing tasks that are close to Bed Block time.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Immediately after activating this app, I saw a positive change in my 12 year old daughter's attitude towards her phone. Do NOT give in to their whining, stay on message with them. She still worships it, but she also understands why I installed it. A great documentary for parents to watch (we did) with children is ""Screenagers"". It shows how we are losing are children to this technology and steps you can take to rectify this issue. My daughter will not be a casualty in that fight thanks to the Screen Time app.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app! It's wonderful and allows me and my son to realize just how much time he's spending playing games and doing homework. I like the ability to monitor his screen time and thanks to this app I can now.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works even better than expected. I can fine tune the controls and I know exactly what my kids are doing on their tablet. The end result is they get more freedom because I feel comfortable letting them use it in ways I felt unsure of before. Excellent app, well worth the subscription.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app for Android.   It has made my child more aware of the amount of time he spends on the phone and I love the daily summary that shows me how long he spent on each app.  I also love that it informs you of any new apps your child installs.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Horrible,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love the degree of control on Android devices: I can set which apps can be used in general, during school hours, before bedtime, and after bedtime.

Setting limits is part of parenting.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I liked the app when I had the free version. Now that I've paid for it I have a much less favourable opinion. The app just doesn't work on my son's new phone. He can play for 2 hrs and it will only show 5 minutes. I tried stopping his phone entirely, and nothing happened. I think this is a major problem - after all, the app doesn't do the very thing it's supposed to do. Also, my kids use this as an excuse - of course I can play, my time hasn't ended yet!  Then there's the issue with multiple devices. You'd think that by adding another device to the same child he'd get the total screen time divided between the devices, but you'd be wrong.  Instead, he gets to use the whole allotted time on both devices! So if you allow them 1 hour and they have two devices, they actually get 2 hours.   The whole point of this application is to not have to monitor screen time by yourself the whole time, but it really doesn't do what it's supposed to do.",1

Seems that it is loses signal it causes the phone to basically not work at all.  In addition most of the features are not supported on IOS.. Really, how can that be?   I thought I was registering for a trial so that I could test the app. Instead they changed me for a FULL YEAR UPFRONT.  After day two I asked to cancel and asked for a full refund.  It's been more then a month and I keep getting the same run around. The billing department is reviewing your request.  I am going to have to have my bank forcefully reverse the changes because they seem to be ignoring me..

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I like the features and it has potential to be an amazing tool but i gave it only 4 stars because it needs some tweaking still. At bedtime every night my daughter is locked out of apps i have allowed like her alarm.

I still find it useful enough to pay for the premium tho.,4

I had not asked it to do that. This app is not suitable for older children or teenagers.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app to control the time your kids spend on their devices. Only improvement would be to have an overall limit, rathet than one per device",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very good app. I like it a lot. It definitely helps me keep control of the usage on my kids phone.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Quite honestly the best app for monitoring kids screen time. I think it should be mandatory for kids. Kids may hate it but it's so necessary!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very helpful to control my kids,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Really nice application manage and follow kids tablets/phones,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Fantastic app. Have tech savvy kids that could get around normal filters. This allows me to not only block the apps i want but also keep an eye on what they up to. Also love bed blocker which allows reading apps etc but blocks games.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Good app, excellent support.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"If you want your kids to have a smart phone yet be in control, protect them from over use or  apps that they shouldn't use, this is the app for you. You're kids might not like it to begin with but they'll live.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Good  ,but can you make to monitor what they are watching in youtube?",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We love it for our Foster Son! Love the pause when he doesnt respond the 1st time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome tool for parents! Devs add am option to set different limits for different days,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app but my son hates it. Why you ask, because it works.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app that works well on Android devices.  The pause function works well for teenagers that like to move at their own pace instead of mine.  Only reason it's not a 5 for me is the Apple integration wasn't smooth.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Couple ways exist to bypass the controls, but overall it's alright. The app is fairly slow though, which is a bummer.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It is the worst thing that has ever happened to the whole world.it makes them angry at me, and it make any thing better,You should take it down.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It was great at first. Then the apps kept locking when I had free play turned on or even when the daily limit was turned off. More problems than a little bit.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"So far, so great! My daughter is not the biggest fan but the alternative is no devices at all. I love the ability to reward extra time & pause as I decide. LOVE the auto block feature on new apps- offering the option to review the app first for appropriateness & decide to unblock definetly sets me at ease.  So many other great features too and the price can't be beat! Installed on both phone & tablet. Great app!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It does the job well although things are a bit different with Apple devices and the time adds up when your screen is on. So your child uses their time even if they are not actually using their devices.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Doesn't tell you it's a free trial until you've spent 10 minutes installing it.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome app.   Puts the power of limit control in the hand of the parent.   Thank you Screen Time!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Lovely easy to use app!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I  like the app ,but my son ? Not so much I just smile and tell him it's my job. :))",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works well and is reasonably priced. I like the easy free play button feature. Its not an ordeal to lock or unlock the phone quickly if I want to. And my daughter had never been more excited about chores,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is an excellent app that I've been using for years. At first it seemed difficult to use but it got easy then on. Thank you Screen Time for your effortless work. You've just got  five stars...,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great help in managing screen time.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This application motivates my kids to do more to earn more screen time. Love being able to pause when to they do not  listen, etc.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Becuase its stops me from being on Insta all day,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is absolutely great for controlling kids smart phone usage,  my only issue is it doesn't have a location monitoring feature which other similar app I have checked out had.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Uninstalled before the the end of trial. The fact that it blocks all installed apps without being able to exclude certain apps or include certain system apps makes Screen Time totally useless (only tested with child's Apple devices).,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Don't make adds for this it's gana Make kids know like me,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app, kids ""hate"" it!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app, my daugter hated me in the beginning, but now she does her tasks so quick to get more time. I would like you to look at daily tasks, because there is tasks she has to do everyday!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It works.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Alot of these bad reviews are from kids that have parents blocking their phones. That's how you know that it's a great app😁😁😁,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Grandson hates it so it must be working the way I hoped.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The very best parental control,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I dont care how mad my child get if he wants to slam his phone on the floor i careless, the fact that this app allows me to control everything my child does on his phone amazes me i wanna thank the creators of this app for doing a superb job",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Nice interface. But my 12 year old hacked it in a day...,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Generally a good app and does most of what I want, which is to limit the amount of time my child spends on the phone. Only issue I have found is that twice when a I am changing the settings to my child account, it shows on my phone that the changes are made, but the changes are not reflected on my child phone. Worked fine all the other times.  It would also be nice if instead of having to block Chrome  if I don't want my child visiting certain sites, I could block just specific sites or group of sites.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Not to happy with the app at the moment. My 13 year old uninstalled the app and after I reinstalled I had a difficult time getting his phone and my phone in sync. I gave him back the phone and he immediately uninstalled the app again. I paid for a full year for an app that a teen ca n disasble.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Amazing app. Built understanding with my kids on proper time usage.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is amazing. It has really helped improve my son's behavior. Him knowing I can be at work and lock his tablet was a huge eye opener. Setting the off time so he can't play while he is supposed to be sleeping is so helpful. Love it. And have recommended to many,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Honestly what made me choose this app was all the negative ratings from teens. This app actually works, and they hate it! As a parent, I love it! I can select what apps to block and when. It also allows me to see what my kids are doing on their phones. Keep getting mad kids, as long as you are protected from all the junk out their I am happy to be the bad guy! Thanks for a parental control app that actually works!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Simple to use. I love that my husband and I can both control it from our phones. My kids share a tablet but I could have 1 each kid with this app. Like the ability to set tasks. The kids tend to complain less when time is up with the app versus being told. My son doesn't like the app but it makes it easier to limit screen time without fuss.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Easy to use, works great. Able to disable installed apps and limit social media while still being able to use the phone for calls and text. My kid would disagree but it works and I recommend it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app, kids not so impressed but getting used to it. Love can limit by individual apps so can give them access to certain apps if use for homework. Bedtime block works a treat too, getting to sleep much earlier. Pause function great when need to get past selective hearing. Youngest kid loves the task function, bed made everyday now & no more squabbles over dishwasher. Thank you guys",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"No more nagging about ""shut off your devices"".   Yes, my kids don't like it but after time they have adjusted.   Now the rules of their screen usage is unspoken and enforced.  Thank you screen time for making my job as a mom a little easier.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app kept saying it couldn't connect to the server. It kept the child's screen locked even after unlocking. Once you delete, very difficult to get the apps to show on the device. Very frustrating!",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a parent, I find this app very useful. It was difficult to limit my son's time on apps such as YouTube. Now I can. I love being able to see what apps they use, limit app usage during school, and blocking during dinner especially.  This app has been wonderful.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have found the app very easy to use. I recommend going through their website to download the app for a teens device.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I only gave this 2 stars because after the 14-day trial you can no longer control anything in the app it all requires premium membership :(,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does exactly what it says it does. I love the pause option.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Works very well and as a parent gives you reassurance about your child's phone use.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Its a great app and well priced, it has given us control over our kids electronic device's without having to confiscate and gave the tantrum",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I can see great potential in this software. Presently it does a good job limiting my daughters time on her devices. Feed ideas to the developers and watch how it blooms. My daughter now gets a good nights sleep and her homework gets done before anything else.  The best bit - I can control everything at home when I am away at work.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Could you stop sending me emails please. I haven't got a chance to set the app up and I have received 5. Im not impressed. Why am I getting updates for nothing! Deleting app and de registering ASAP.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's annoying,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Amazing app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Not sure about this app at all.. Keep crashing on kids iPad... Get my app doesn't work often.. Regretting paying for the whole year... Look around more before buying this app and also don't pay for a year...,2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app, works excellent, I definitely recommend. Ignore bad reviews from grouchy kids",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app works great, it keeps me informed, easy to handle and best of all it has decreased arguments and hasles",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I am not able to check the web or search history in my kids' mobiles since they are operated by Marshmallow or Nougat Android versions. How to resolve this issue?? Still find this app the most amazing parental control application ever.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The fact that kids are destroying their ratings by rating it one star tells you Just how effective this app is. Though they really should love the fact that we can add more time if they deserve a reward or complete a chore.  Literally *THE BEST* parental app out there for every conceivable need when you love your kid!! Our job is to regulate what they're not ready to. This app lets me do that in every way. My gratitude is boundless.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app helps so much with my kids. I love it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So disappointing that you have to pay when there's like 1000+ ways to deactivate the apps screen time making the app a waste of everyone's time and why can't it be like 50 cents a month instead of so much money like 48$ per year also it is auto pay,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,it has what you need,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Just what we needed!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I had the original Screen Time installed and it worked great. I had to do a factory reset and had to install this and the companion.  Now you have to pay to limit time, which was free. The description is misleading as you have to pay the monthly payment in order to limit the time.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Like most kids...my daughter hates this app, but that just means it is working like it is supposed to! It would be nice to have a timer on the ""pause"" feature and a better way to control the phone use after school (before bedtime). More controls for the school hours would be nice too...i.e. free time during lunch.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I gives me a peace of mind given that given my kids electronics it's a mater of necessity at this moment  more than pleasure.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Brilliant app!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is amazing. Best 3.99 per month I've spent.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app, but wish I didn't have to log into my kids' phones to change password.  They send the password reminder, delete the email and then change the blocks as they wish.  I wish I could do all controls from my phone, not emails, or kids phone. Plus, no way to change email",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Installed on our devices to monitor kids app time. Love it! I can easily set time limits and pause their devices if I need them to do a chore or come to dinner.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Fantastic. Does exactly what it's supposed to yet provides a lot of flexibility. Highly recommend,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is GREAT!!!!!!!! I don't even have to tell my son to get off and do what ever I need him to do. I love it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love love love this app system! It has made my son's phone into a useful tool instead of area of concern and arguing. I upgraded to premium because it is so worth the peace of mind. I love the way it emails me when the password is entered to override controls so I can keep track of when it is me and when the password may be compromised. They've thought of everything and are constantly improving things.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's a good concept.  But it doesn't work. All they have to do is turn the phone off and back on or clear all the apps and it turns itself off,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is a very good application,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Has'nt worked for ages, checked my account to see why, found that premium was'nt enabled even though I paid for it...",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's very helpful during bed time and at school, the only thing thats missing is adding desktops and laptops to this app. Other then that it's very easy to use.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app, it helps get my son outside and off his phone. It's easy to use and the in app chat support is great.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I am loving this app. It is limiting my son's app/game time when I'm at work. He can earn more time. It is getting him up and being more creative,  helpful and reading more without me having to say anything. He knows how much time he has and that is it for the day and to make sure he uses it wisely.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is an awesome resource!  Love the ability to reward behaviors and tasks completed.  Easy to use and understand.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great App Low Price! I love that I can block game apps and other apps that waste time but still keep access to important apps for school and homework. A couple of suggestions, allow option for bed time without using lights out. I don't like blocking all phone access in case of an emergency. Also, I would love this for their laptops!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great way to monitor activity without being too invasive - highly recommended!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works really well,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome app for tracking and safeguarding kids tablets!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is amazing. Have not had any issues yet and working like a charm. Thank you,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My child easily uninstall the app from home screen. It doesn't work as promised. I also can't see children's Web history..... This shouldn't be premium quality.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I actually paid for this service and I am super disappointed! My daughter keeps figuring out how to disable this app without my permission and it's so frustrating because I paid for it for 6 months and I have paid for nothing!!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The app doesn't work,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's snowing for me but ya,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great way to monitor and regulate how much time kids are on the phone and doing what. Love the feature to shut things down at bedtime.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Amazing app. It is easy to use and it has some great features. I particularly enjoy the fact that the app itself is not too intrusive i.e. it doesn't monitor everything the child does. You can't control a child too much.   Anyway...the ability to create tasks and reward the kid with some extra screen time is another good feature.   It used to be a chore to get him to read. But now after only 1 week of using screentime, and the promise of an extra hour on his phone, his reading has drastically improved.  The only issue I have is the fact that you can't have different time limits for separate devices.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Definitely great app. Recommended for all parents. Please notice children gives only one star here so in fact this app should have around five stars if exclude their votes.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Totally unnecessary monthly fee to activate basic features other apps have for free or a one time app purchase.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,it sucked,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have been using Screen Time for the past several months after installing and trying out other parental control apps. Screen Time, in my opinion is by far the best parental application. This will not intrude on your children privacy, but allows you to control and limit what applications are used by your children. They also have a very responsive customer service.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app. It makes taking control of the screen time easier... Less conflict and more incentive for my kids to listen THE FIRST TIME. Thank you for making it just a little easier to be in control!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It has some serious flaws... my son can prevent from me pausing his phone by going offline. There's nothing to notify me he had gone offline, not mentioning taking the control back.   Another thing I've noticed is weak a spot. If settings are not blocked the child can uninstall it. When  it is installed back on their device the daily limit on the child's phone us unused, whereas on mine it shows ie. 45mins left...   If I'm to go premium I need some back up from you guys. For example to have an automatic block on all features apart from call and text when child decides to go offline. Not sure how functional this is but then it would be worth paying for.   There's no use of this app if my child can override the aimed restrictions!",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Very clever and effective app. Great controls over exactly what is and isn't allowed, intuitive setting of bedtimes etc, handy free play button to make exceptions. And fantastic customer service too! My wife and I recommend this app highly.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Used it within the hour; my phone froze when checking & apps on my nephew's ipad kept blocking when there is still time to the daily limit,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Literally life changing - an end to fruitless argument.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The app seemed to work well and there were lots of great features but I find the monthly subscription misleading.,2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is phenomenal!   My son was becoming addicted to his tablet and YouTube videos.   But within the first week of having Screen Time downloaded I noticed a change in his behavior and the benefits of upgrading to the premium.   It's been 3 weeks of having this app on his tablet and he now looks for tasks to complete to gain more time doesn't throw fits when it's time to shut it off and get ready for bed, and he understands he only has so much time daily to use his tablet and no longer tries to watch YouTube first thing in the morning.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Would have been 5 stars, but there are some quirks (like strange display issues when swiping from one child to another)",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I generally love the app. It gives me control in many places that I need it. The one thing I feel may be lacking is maybe a way to set times outside of bedtime or school time that I can custom block certain things like when my kids need to start on their chores or homework. I would still like them to use their tablet for research and reading and block distractions like games and videos while they do so. This resorts me to using the school blocker function for these needs to be timed to fit our routine. But since it's capable of this loophole, it's very much a solid app.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Easy to use. Very effective. In the past I had to take away the phone to avoid distractions, but then I could not reach my son. This allows me to remove distractions from school work without removing the ability to communicate. It also gives the ability to monitor phone usage at night and during school or homework hours. I find it humorous in the reviews when people complain about paying for the extra controls. When they go to work every day do they volunteer without pay? How do they pay their bills?",5

Have noted the following issues: 1) blocked one of the i-pads by constantly failing to un-block applications despite lack of any time restriction; I was forced to dis-install the programme; 2) tasks did not show on my phone as pending despite being assigned to children; 3) the image of one of my children would not appear anymore but was replaced by the turning wheel (when the application is retrieving data), which prevented me from selecting this task for assignment of tasks; 4) lack of online reply is infuriating when confronted to a total blockage problem as described in 1) above. Conclusion: too many glitches resulted in my children bombarding me with phone calls while at work, to solve the app problems. I am disappointed with this trial and will not use Screen Time.",2

I have a request though... if you can add the option to distribute the allowed time over a period of time. for example: 30 min every 3 hours... 10 min every one our... this way I can force her to take rests and do something else every hour or so... because right now what ever I setup my daughter will spend in one session then for the rest of the day she keeps crying and bugging me to give her some more time because she finished all the time she had... and this happens especially on weekends... she have a long day and just three hours allowed on the TAB, so she spend the three hours in one go and then keeps asking me for more during the remaining 10 hours of her day!",5

Improvements that should be made are text/email logging as well as a keylogger and pic/vid viewing. May as well throw in child GPS locating too --  then it'd be 5 stars, imho.    It's a shame that these butthurt, feral kids are able to get on here and give this app a bad review. For any adult that is considering this app, each one star review from someone who is obviously a kid should prove that the app works, and works well.",4

This app froze on the edit screen of the parent phone for 2 days then just when I got my end working, it froze my son's phone. His phone was completely useless, we were unable to even power it down.

Another words it only destroys the family unless you have very obedient children, but if you do why are you getting this app?",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This has been really helpful for my family. I know some kids complain about it, but this actually has allowed me to give my children more flexibility and use on their Kindle Fire tablets. The fire launcher is not very flexible. Screen Time has made is so I can give them unlimited access to their camera, music, email, calculator, educational games, and other things. But it still allows me to limit purchases and ""fluff"" games. Or to pause the tablet if they are neglecting their responsibilities.   I really like the ability to add tasks and rewards and my children love to earn extra time that way. There are more features I'd like to see but things have improved a lot from using Screen Time.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app!  Simple to use and my child is ok with it.  Thanks!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Like another parent said, i kind of feel guilty how much control over my sons phone i have, but we have to be diligent in protecting our kids until they're old enough to be making the right decisions. Greatest app ever invented for this purpose. Highly customizable and limiting to the time consumption you're comfortable with; also able to pre-block anything new til you're able to check it out. As more and more kids get phones and tablets, this app should be the norm if you care at all for them.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works as described,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Nice app with good features.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works great, let's me control daily screen time, bedtime, and restrict apps!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Really helpful in managing our children's devices,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I didn't know I will be charged automatically for using this app. If I know, I would not have used it.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Horrible,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The best I've seen. Very easy and fit for purpose. Keep it up pls,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It works well in theory, but just theory. It was buggy and didn't block some app it was supposed to, and blocked apps it wasn't supposed to. In the end I just got rid of it.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,so helpful to be a parents,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Nice app to control usage of our parent's phones. Good work! Now they only have 5 minutes of screen tine per day! Thanks screen time labs!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Halfway through the trial period and so far LOVE this app will most definitely puchase a subsciption and apply it to all devices. It is fantastic that I can limit the amount of time spent playing games on the phone and the times the games are accessible. I love that I can block the apps he doesn't need or I that I don't feel he should be accessing and I can monitor what apps he is using and what he is searching on the web. Highly recommend.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Brilliant way to control your child's screen time.  Currently still in free trial mode, so not sure how many features will be disabled when it runs out.  My two boys (8 & 10) get along ok with it and have accepted that if they do some tasks and behave they can have more time added.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to understand self explanatory,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I had initially installed a different parental control app (Qustodio) on my son's phone but it caused lots of arguments and wasn't actually giving me the ability to restrict the smart phone functions whilst allowing use as a simple phone (which is what I wanted). Screentime offers significantly more flexibility - such as allowing use of phone and camera functions while blocking access to apps or Google. He is happier and I am too - a sensible price and sensible functions.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Amazing app, I finally am in complete control of my kids tablets! Love it! 😃",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is Awesome!!!!!!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works very well. Intuitive to use. Better than some enterprise targeted apps I have seen (and a hell of a lot cheaper),5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Everytime I open up my phone with this on, my phone shuts down only 5 minutes later. So it restarts whatever I am doing, and when almost everything I do with my phone is over 5 minutes. It gets real irritating whenever it does things like this.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. It has made a world of difference in my life. My daughter will actually complete chores for extra time!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome app great accountability software for kids definitely worth the money and having the free trial was so generous and awesome!!! Thanks guys!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Perfect for controlling screen time, easy to use.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is wonderful. It allows parents to let their children manage their time. Being able to add extra time when chores are completed saves time previously spent nagging.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Reasonable features until you realize everything is behind a pay wall.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Greatest app for me to limit my kids usage on their darn phones. My kids were spending 12-15 hours a day on the internet. Now I'm in control with this app and they may not like it but it gets them outside playing and even gets them to do chores. If they want to have internet then they nee to do their chores and homework or I can just shut it down.. I absolutely love this app greatest thing  I've ever done was download this app... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Brilliant for limiting digital time and allowing us to monitor what the kids are doing.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I wish I had installed this app 4 years ago!!!  Less screen time has made tome for other wholesome activities!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app you can mange you kids usage time and also moniter their actvitis easy to use,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,That phone you gave to your child for Christmas is 'supposed' to belong to them. With this app you can stop them from using that phone as it is meant to and how they want to.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I like this app a lot. Even my son (8), who was the reason I got the app, has responded really well. He can see how much usage he had left, which had made him more judicious in his use. Also, instead of nagging to do chores he does them without prompting and likes sending me a picture, or if I do ask, he doesn't argue nearly as much.   One thing I would like is the ability to send him a message without pausing. To give him a chance to stop on his own without having to yell across the house. Or a timer that can pop up and say ""2 minutes until dinner, finish up"" because while I love the pause function, it doesn't give them a chance to finish their round or prepare for turning off the tablet. I think giving them that chance would be good for them.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,LOVE this app! Makes setting limits easy and uncomplicated. I especially love being able to pause and send a message (i.e. come help unload groceries!),5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app to help kids be aware of how much time they spend using devices. Highly recommended for parents!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Can be used as a tool to motivate the kid if used correctly.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is an essential tool for perents. It works very well and is simple to set up. My kids have started moving and interacting with the real world again. Whilst my kids don't like having limits on their devices they appreciate it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The app is not working properly and is not able to turn off. Dont recomend at all.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My dad installed this app on my phone to limit my screen time and protect me online. Although sometimes I am annoyed, it serves it's purpose. Whenever I have a problem, I just tell my dad and he fixes it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We have been using this app for almost a year. It has worked well for us. Kids are 9-17 and have access to smart phones, tablets, and ipods.  An improvement that would make it 5 stars: Update the app to monitor/control apple devises as easily as android devises. I like that I can still set time limits, but can't chose which apps are limited and which ones can remain open.  All in all, after trying several different apps, this one still works best for our family.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I absolutely hate this app it never helps me and I get very tense and angry!!!😠,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I tried several different monitoring apps before settling on this one. It works logically and covers all the different ways you might like to manage screen use. Its reliable and robust while flexible enough to customize it. Really good app. Also great value for money.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Its good but in order to do anything you have to pay for it,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Absolutely incredible love having the control over my two boys devices and knowing how much screen time they are having and being able to freeze the device at school and bedtime fantastic features,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great low price option to keep your kids locked down.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love it to use and keep track of of all the apps that are being used and set time limits for apps as well. My kid hates it but get him moving doing extra stuff and chores to earn extra time with no fights. It's wonderful.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've tried many apps before, and always had an issue with something. But this one is perfect.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,There is a big backdoor...my son reinstalled it during allowed time and that's it the control was lost,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Horrible,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Thanks for making me hate myself more,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I Love Screen Time! I've been using this app since January after diving into the mobile electronic world with my 7 and 9 year old kids. It allows me to control the amount of time my kids spend on their device, what times of day they can use it, etc. You can even offer them incentives. All from your phone!! Highly recommended! I no longer have to ask them to get off their tablet. Screen Time let's them know when their time is up. A life saver.  UPDATE-7/31/17: We went without ScreenTime for about 6 weeks because of some issues with an update to my kids' Kindle OS. It was torture!  We were back to arguing about how much time they could have, them not being honest about their time usage, etc. I was so relieved when Screen Time Labs contacted me to let me know that they had made major updates to the app. The new version is wonderful and works seamlessly with the Kindles. If you look closely at the bad reviews on here you will see that they are from disgruntled kids who are upset that they are now effectively limited on screen usage.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great program,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It sucks and it is very low quality! Also very unfair to children,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Stupidest thing every created,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Reduced features and more rubbish to justify more money. Unintelligible as a result. Pointless  Despite their comments about reduced features to improve doesn't follow basic logic unless you ad the revenue stream in. Over priced and can be bypassed with knowledge available on several forums: forgivable for free but not paid product.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best parent control app available. Love the new feature of being able to remotely pause the kids' tablets!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Perfect way to get them unglued from the screens, get them participating in life and back to EARNING the screen time. Love it!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app for controlling and reviewing my child's phone usage. Only negative is once their time is out they can't turn off the phone.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It was hard work setting up - kept asking me to change the name of the child. Only managed to escape the process by adding a second child. Also, I would really like a weekly limit as well as the daily. Its really important for kids to learn to self manage their screen time, not jist over a day but over a longer time. Otherwise they are just constantly on the dopamine come down waiting for their next fix. One other niggle is that if a blocked app os loaded on the childs phone and I unblock it on mine. The app has to be fully closed down before it recognises that it has unblocked.  Other than all that it seems like a good app",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Invaluable tool to control your kids time on it. Well worth the subscription. Go for it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Easy to use,  customer support is fast.  My 12 yr old hasn't hacked it yet.  We have android devices so this app gives me the precise control my son needs.  I can block internet or games at my discretion while still leaving him access to the apps he needs at school.  No more bad reports that he's playing video games during class.  I've been very pleased so far.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have complet control over my kids phones and what they can download i love it works great!!💛💛☺☺,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app allows you to quickly and easily track what you child is doing throughout the day. Also, it lets you easily control what your child is allowed on and not. However, it is extremely frustrating for the child using it as it blocks the whole screen sometimes, even if some apps are available. Also, what I say is from personal experience since... I am the child",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,After a year of use my children were able to find a way around the security. Good for younger children. Not as good for teenagers.,3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Does exactly what it is meant to do. With the best will in the world I find it hard to consistently monitor time spent on screens but this app does it for me. Also teaches children the concept of time and how long 10mins is etc. Would definitely recommend.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app blocked all my kid's apps twice and could only be fixed by uninstalling and reinstalling. The first time I did, the second time I did not. She also says it messes with how she ordered her apps (and hates it).  I was also disappointed that I can't see which apps my kid was using on her iPhone. (Our concern being that she was over using a particular one that I didn't think was that great).  We may still reinstall it. Or we may simply set her a weekly limit if we can find a way to check on her own device how long (and ideally what) apps she is using.   I gave this an un-generous 2 rating because of the App freezing. I think this could still turn out to be a much better App over time though.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Very helpful in limiting the time my kids are on their devices without fighting over it every time.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I absolutely love this app, honestly! It's great how you can restrict usage and apps on your child's phone and tablet.  I love that you can set different limits, for bed, school, and daily usage.   The pause and free play feature is also great if you want to block the device temporarily or add time when it's normally blocked. I really like how apps are hidden on iPhones when the device is blocked.   Other great features include adding chores and good deeds for extra time.   The only downside is my kids who are 11 and 10 found it very easy to uninstall the app. I found a way to get round this issue on Android but its not so easy for iPhones.  However, this is no fault of the developer as it's regulations set by Apple. I was offered a number of solutions to reduce the ability to delete the app it disable profiles for iPhones.    Totally worth the money I spent on it!",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. My daughter seems to be able to hack these parental control apps. She did with this one too but the team advised of a simple tip (I probably can't mention here) that would prevent that. Seems to have worked a treat! Thank you,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've wasted a lot of time on other apps but I am so glad to finally find one that is easy to use, fair and without technical bugs. Your search for this type of app stops here. Congratulations and thanks so much to Oliver the developer. He should get an award for this awesome app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It took me a while to figure out just how my daughter got around the password to uninstall the app.  She would go onto my other devices & see the password in my email.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Brilliant app! Screen Time is a fantastic idea really well implemented! It allows us control and my kiddies are much happier now than when my wife and I used to try and get them off their tablets. Plus they can do chores and nice things to earn more time. Highly recommended!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Would love to see a feature that allows the option to copy settings across multiple children. Would also like to strongly encourage you to develop an app for gaming consoles that syncs with this. Absolutely the best app though!

Customer service is fantastic, please contact them if you're having any issues as they've assisted us well.

I'm still not sure of what the monthly fee is yet? I still have a few days of the free trial, but I'm sure it will be worth it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Half way through my trial and I really found this app useful. The design is good and user friendly. I can limit which apps my kids use and for how long, I can also monitor their browsing history and search history. I can assign them extra time if they do chores, or perhaps on special occasions. Also I must say their support is superb, you can communicate with the support team directly from the app and they usually respond very quickly, I really love that. They are also open to new suggestions which is great. I would definitely recommend this product to all parents who have children",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have this app on two of my children's phones and I love it. It just keeps getting better and better. More improvements all the time. The second you let someone know you have a hiccup on the app, a person is always answering and willing to give assistance. Easy to use. I feel like I am really monitoring my children at all times on what they can and cannot do with their phones. Perfect for our family. Love.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,super easy to use.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Terrible. Used to be great. A child with an Apple product can just uninstall. Same on Android. To work, you have to allow VPN. No thanks. Also Android interface is horrible. Used to be good, but now it's terrible. Do not install. Written by a PARENT.",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,as a parent this app is great. only use it to control the time spent on divice. it gives my child structure ans learn tile management. what is missing is an alarm to can be set every hour to notify them about the remaining allocated time .,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is fabulous. Our daughter was unable to put limits on herself with the use of the iPad, and she actually mostly likes this! Of course she gets annoyed when her time runs out and it locks, but she loves the task elements, she is completing her tasks in order to earn the extra time.  We change up the tasks over the school holidays and it's been working really well. Highly recommend this.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I'd give it 5 stars if I had the same control of my sons iPad as it does my daughters Samsung tab..,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app works great as I can limit my son's access to smartphone and apps. I can call his attention by pausing access to it, however,  I think it would be more great if there is a way that I can plot, say, an hour of rest after a 3 hours of use, probably about 2 or 3x of 1 hr rest in a day of use thereby automating the rest instead of using the ""pause"" feature.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It does what it says on the tin and it's a great tool for controlling the amount of time your child spends on a screen  . As parents of a teenager we love it and although the teenager doesnt love it she understands why its there ! Well most of the time ! My only criticism is that it works well on android but not so well on Apple devices...but I'm hoping you're working on that.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I think it is stupid,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Kids will hate it. Parents will love it.,5

Love that I can pause mid game if needed 😂😂 they however do not like that . I will and have used it haha..im glad i found this...only had since june but its def a keeper,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is the best thing every,  no more straggling to get my son to hand his phone over I can just press the pause with in seconds and he can't use his phone, also he is learning to make the most of his time that he has on his limit (he is 17 with learning difficulties) so it's teaching him responsibility",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Tech savvy 12 year old managed to uninstal by deleting himself from the app on my phone when I wasn't looking and then uninstalling from his phone without needing a password. He also managed to remove the device admin permissions on his little brother's tablet!!,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have looked for an app that does everything this does! It is amazing and my kids are FINALLY doing chores without me even saying anything to them! The instant pause is awesome! My kids get an attitude or anything and I can immediately lock their tablets! Amazing app and definitely worth the money for the upgrade!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Haven't found a flaw yet love the app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have been using this app for years on my kids' Android tablets. It is worth every penny.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Had this for over 6 months now. In the beginning iPad had a lot of issues losing connection and kids losing all the apps. Android works flawlessly. Real easy to monitor the amount of time kids spend on devices. Easy to shut down kids activity without having to chase them down and physically take the device when we need their attention. I will buy another year when time comes due. Kids don't like it go figure :),5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Its the most annoying and a stupidest app that my kidz ever,1

Ive tried to set up hotspot, but the purple screen keeps popping up. So i cant even get to the wifi settings.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I don't even know what I would do without this such a handful tool! Thanks a lot for your efforts!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to use and dies exactly what it needs to do.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have been looking for an app like this an I have finally found it!  To get buy in from your kids, you need to sit down and talk with them first.  You need to walk them through the app and show them how it is going to affect their screen time going forward. How they can earn time. What apps are allowed to use and which one may or may not be allowed to use at certain times of the day, say at bedtime, or school, i.e. games, youtube, etc.  You'll get negative feedback from them regardless of the parental control app if only used as a way to control their screen time. Give them the responsibility to earn time, earn your trust, and freedom of knowing their boundaries.  The reason why I like this app is the ability to set healthy boundaries for my kids as well as give them the chance to earn time through the chores/task part of the app. I don't have to tell my kids to do chores anymore, if they don't do chores they don't earn extra screen time. The chores/task part of the app doesn't necessarily have to be chores, but can be a reward for whatever you put in there.   Some other reasons;  1. Giving my kids the freedom of using their device when ever, instead of me watching the time and being the bad guy. 2. Alerted to new apps they down load, and giving me the ability to research the app, when I have time, before they are allowed to use it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to setup. Flexible settings,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Doesn't log the times my children are playing.  Tired reconnecting both tablets,  but still doesn't work.  My daughter was up all night playing and no record log on what she did.  Very disappointed. I WILL NOT be renewing this.!",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Helps track my kid's activity AND prevents my ex from installing software to track me (which sadly he's done before). The ability to log what apps are running and when something was downloaded - and then block inappropriate apps is exactly what I needed!  Thank you!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works great when kids don't listen or do as their told. You just open the app, select which child and tap the pause button. Pesto, they coming running to do what they've been told to do. I wish I could add the Chromebook to the list of devices to pause but I'm not sure if that's possible.... yet.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Super easy to use....I love being able to control their apps and their time....and the fact that they ""know"" I can see what they are doing helps more just in itself....I think they are more cautious of what they watch and do because they know mom is watching :-)",5

A bit confusing at initial setup, as you get 3 or 4 time categories in which you should select the apps you block or enable. You should have an idea what that apps do on the device, say, I didn't block the telephone or messages in case of some urgent communication needed. Overall very powerful application to make children look outside their screens.",5

My child has been able to download apps, use social media, use websites and various other things simply by using the Android guest account.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is great. My son hates it and I'm officially the worse mum in the world! Having that little bit of control over the time and apps is so reassuring.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Screen Time is an amazing app that even my daughter can appreciate! She has type 1 diabetes, and uses her tablet to keep track of her blood glucose levels. While she loves playing games, watching videos and TV, her mood and attention span suffer if she spends too much time staring at screens (she even notices, although she still moans when we remind her of her 2 hour a day TV/gaming/tablet limit). With this app, and its companion, I can lock down all apps that count towards her daily screen limit, but leave open her diabetes app, as well as a few educational apps.   Being able to allow her to have her tablet with her at all times, yet know that she can't sneak in extra time on ""limited"" apps is a relief for both her and myself. She gets upset that she can't trust herself with screens (promise I am not making this up! my daughter is very self aware for her age), and loves that she can have her tablet with no worries that she might give into temptation and play games instead of studying, doing chores, etc.   My only ""complaint"" is that you have less options in the free version versus the premium. However, I went ahead and bought the year subscription (even though funds are VERY tight with us right now) beacuse the prices are more than reasonable for the peace of mind this app gives my entire family.",4

And possibly limit times on selected apps.  A locator would be a bonus so I could find my child/their device would make it the perfect app.  Others that have that feature fall far short to Screen Times time limiter abilities.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is AWSOME! I'm a kid so I got this app in order to keep myself in check on my screen time because I am an internet addict. I asked my mom to make a passcode that I couldn't know, set permissions for myself, and I'm so much happier now! It makes it absolutely impossible to get around! Changing permissions takes the passcode, and it is impossible to delete! It is great because it also has a different weekend setting if you want it, and you can uncheck apps that you need, and you'll never get stuck on technology again! This is like an alarm clock that makes you always get out of bed! I am thoroughly pleased with this app! Thank you screen time for giving me my life back!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"At first glance I was excited about the app and the permissions available. But not long after I decided to purchase the app things started going wrong.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Well, I would like to give it a five star but somehow this app is not very stable. So kids device is an iPad, I am using Android device, everytime I want to grant some play time it doesn't work, I need to swipe close the app in the iPad and reopen it, and then select the option to get all the apps back on screen. It looks like it can not do it by itself, that's why I give a 3 stars instead of a 5 stars",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Hate it I need control over my phone. Only plco trol freak power hungry idiotic parents will install this app on their parents phones. I for one had this forced on my device a second time without knowing. And I know a way to get the password and cheat the force out closing of the app so yah can't control my phone,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have a very avid screen user. He is nine and this app is wonderful. I actually get to see and interact with my child in the real world. Thank you screentime for making this possible!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Annoying,3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great apps..,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We were always at odds with our teenager about how long she's on her device. We've also noticed that when she was grounded from her device on occasions, she was way more social and seemed happier. This app gives us exactly what we needed. A monitor and a limit setter, all-in-one! We just set limits and let it do the rest! Definitely a parents best friend. I don't mind paying for a subscription. Everyone's always wanting something for nothing these days! At least it's a reasonable price. Plus, customer service is top notch! Thanks for a great app!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app. Has helped a lot with our son with ASD. The bedtime lockout is great, he now just gets ready for bed. It's helped a lot as he now plays with his other toys a lot more, he's hardly used his device is the last week after about a month using the app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is one of the best apps to control contents on your kids devices. I have tested it and I paid for 14 months subscription. What I mostly love about this app the tasks where your kids can do chores around the house for extra screen time. I have already recommended this app to a lot of friends.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app 😍,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It doesnt work, my daughter is 14 and she knows how to over ride it, even if the app (eg fb or snapchat ) is blocked and bedtime is on shes shown me how she can access her apps quite easily.",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this App. I have twins and I have total control over what they see and do on their devices. There is an alert anytime they add or delete an app. I can see everything. I had been looking for something that I could operate from my phone and I have found it here with screentime. The one thing that drives my kids crazy is when I ask them to do something and they are on the phone and they ignore me, now I can pause their phone until the task is complete from my phone, then I can let them play again. Awesome app. Worth every penny!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Sucks does.not.work,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Far to expensive after the trial,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The best App ever!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Cancelled in April 2017 in May 2017 they took funds from my account. Have tried to reach someone numerous times and haven't gotten a response.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works wonderfully on our android devices but had trouble installing it on our ipads and had limited features on the ipad in terms of app blocking. We think its great though, we've experienced no glichs and the yearly cost is minimal per family, its great that its not per device or child as we have a lot of both!!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Sets real and clear limits.  We no longer have the fight about "" I'm not really on it much"".  Highly recommend.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love the amount of control it allows you to have, and that you can change things around depending on your child's maturity and positive use of their phone.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The FREE version is almost pointless. The 2 week free trial we got of the Premium was awesome. But not for $15/mo. My son is just going to have to live with certain apps requiring my password or he can just go be a normal kid without an electronic.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Happy with this App on every level.  Made our child accountable and responsible for time management.  I like the daily reports. Most importantly it is the awareness and I'm already seeing a difference in how our child manages screentime.  Great App! Keep it up.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,A bit disappointed 'cause I used this app about a year ago and decided to use it again today but can't do so 'cause the companion app on my kid's phone that I've installed before cannot be deleted. I have forgotten the password I've used then and don't know how to retrieve or reset it.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great product makes parents life easier,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We Love it!!! He has a set time limit and it warns him when its ending. I've also set times he can have it throughout the day as well. I can send him messages to do things and pause the game or app for as long as I want untill hes done the chore or task. I can also add time if he deserves it from anywhere. I've sent him additional time while I'm at work...very happy with this app. My son not so much but he's finally accepted it and I have control of tablet time again. Thank you,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is a life changer. Great for monitoring kids usage.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is great for my 7 year old to help us limit him and to help him learn to limit himself. It's nice to see what apps he is using as well. I really like that I can add time for him and block him after bedtime.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is amazing. I couldn't imagine my child having a phone or tablet without this. Supervision is a must when it comes to the internet. The only thing I would like to change is being able to put a limit on individual apps instead of the entire phone.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is really easy to use.  It has been a great way to keep my son (10) accountable with his time on tablets and phone.  As well it helps to give him incentives to get more time on his devices.  Highly recommend,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I installed this app on my son's phone 2 weeks ago and utilized the 14 day free trial. I just paid the fee because it's been extremely effective! Here is my in depth review. I personally don't use the time limits with my son (he is 13),  so I can't speak much about those. In the event my son finds himself grounded, I will use the time block and make him do stuff to earn time. I use it primarily for bed time and school. His constant excuse has always been, ""but I just want to listen to music!"". I'm not naive and I know he was doing more than listening to music, but without proof I wasn't going to accuse him!!! I put the app on his phone and monitored his activity for 2 days before setting any blocks and telling him it was there. 3:30 am Clash of Clans is apparently a thing in his world no matter what night of the week ... correction ... WAS a thing. We had a long talk and I informed him that this was on his phone AND what it does. All apps except iheart radio disable at bedtime. End of story. All apps except the calculator, iheart radio, and calls are disabled during school. I really like that it tells they can't use a certain app, but here is a list of what you can use. I like the pause and play feature, though I haven't had to use it much. I like that I can see every app on his phone AND when he installs new ones AND logs of his use/searches AND when his phone is active. I like that I control the app for the most part and not the other way around!   What I would like to see ...  •I would like to be able to create my own block of time for whatever purpose I want. For instance, I would like to create a mon-thur, 5-6 block for homework.   •I would like to be sent a notification when settings are accessed. I'm not too worried about him disabling the app because I told him if I see ANY attempt to work around the app, I will own his phone for 2 straight months. No negotiations!!!   •There may be a way to block specific things permanently and I just haven't found it, but the easiest way to stop them from disabling the app(for those worried about that child disabling the app) would be to block their access to settings.",5

So like, when I am on data away from my child, and he is on wifi, it stops working.  I cannot send him messages, approve tasks, change anything.  That needs to be changed.  Otherwise, I love it.  I have had it a while, and my kids hate it.  That should tell you it's great.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a parent, this app is a great way to keep your kids device time and responsibility time in check. For security purposes, it reports what they search for, sites they visit, and how much time they spend at the site. It also permits you to block access to any apps installed/websites that you deem inappropriate, as well as other functions of the tablet. You can even schedule times the tablet will be on and off, such as bedtimes or even during school and study times. You can also create tasks (chores), that once completed, reward additional device time. If chores aren't getting done, you can lock down their device until you see things improve. This can all be done right from your own device, and you even get a report emailed to you once a week. For parents looking to get their kids responsibilities under control and ensure their online safety, this app is excellent and it works for our two boys (10 and 11). Chores and schoolwork are getting done, and they're being rewarded for their hard work. Easily work $1 a week regardless of how many devices/kids in your family.  Your kids will pour on the drama about how awful it is, but that just means you're doing something right.",5

He actually looks for stuff to do to earn time, but most of the time he doesn't even use it. I bought the subscription and will probably keep it until I know he can self manage.",5

I can see the basic programs she is using and set bedtime limits. She can earn extra phone time by completing tasks I approve. This program has given me a fabulous tool for rewarding behavior and giving consequences. I recommend it for every parent with a teenager.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Keeps freezing. I had to add my kids twice because it didn't update. I'm looking for better.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It has helped me stay off my phone,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is stupid,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I'm so happy to have stumbled across this app!  My son was so mad when I installed it. But as soon as he realized that it didn't really change much, other than set time limits for bed time and wake time, he calmed down a bit!  He tried me with his homework once and all I had to say is I'm getting hit fingers and he's like alright, I'm going to do It!   I absolutely love this app. I will be purchasing after my free trial is up!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app! I didn't know their was something out there, this great to monitor my children!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is great.  We've got total control and supervision.  It even allows for exceptions, so our son can listen to his audio books when he goes to bed, but access no other apps.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I've tried several apps and this is the best. Easy and effective.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app would be better if I were able to set the times and limit apps for each device separately. Now, one set of standards has to suffice for all devices. I.e. I can't limit my son's time to 30 minutes on his mobile and 45 min. on his Kindle.  Your service dept. is amazing: responsive, quick, concerned, helpful! Wow. Raising my rating from three to four stars (and one half, if it were possible), as there are still a few links to work out, but the team at Screen Time really seems on top of it.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app....easy to set up and use.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My kids respect IT ! They understand that we downloaded this app to help them learn to balance work and play. 📚🎮They learn to focus on what really is important in life (education) not games. 📐 They get rewarded free time for doing lessons, chores and doing nice things. 🎡📑🎧",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to use & effective,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Absolutly wonderful. This is a great app for parents, less so for those smartphone hungry kids who don't quite understand control & restraint!  Highly Recommended as an android user & parent, able to teach my two there is more to life than apps, games & smartphones",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is just what we've been looking for boys not keen at first but like the idea and compete with each other to earn more time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My kids hate this app! Let's me control how much internet they see. My eldest came down the stairs screaming at me the other day as her tab had switched off. Perfect!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Super awesome app!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The best for all families trying to control the influence this world has on our children,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Parents installing this app will cause your children to be more desperate to find underhand ways to bypass the security which in the end will not work well on your relationship with your children. So take this as a sarcastic 5 star,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app does exactly what it says it will,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It was a good change over for me n my teen daughter and also my 3 young boys. They are always on the gadgets especially my daughter. Having this app really helps me alot. The best part is controlling their daily limit on the gadget itself and also blocking their apps from their usage.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I really liked the app before but I love the look of the update. All the information for a child is viewable now. I don't have to go into each setting page to see what has been setup.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is a real game changer in our family. Parents get control back over raising their children and not letting internet & screens take over their lives. This is a whole different world to grow up in now.  This app lets you reign it back in. Take charge of your kids the way it was intended to be. No kore running amok. It teaches them to budget their time in a more responsible manner.  My child actually surfaces now and we have more face to face contact.   Add a couple more features like sms tracking over multiple platforms ie: instagram and amino communities and it would be perfect!  P.s. love the look with the new update !,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is amazing. I love that I can see the web history on there tablets, but my favorite things is they don't throw a fit anymore when there time ends. Love it!!!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Free trial for 15 days will get you hooked!  It's great to control your child's content, and be able to limit time on devices...any time ...even when they don't listen to you...you control their fixation of device use.

Love the app, the developer is brilliant guy with great sense of humour!   The monthly cost of the app after trial expires is well below the cost of a pint in London. It is a steal :)  Technicaly, the app is very robust and responsive, clearly designed with by a knowlegable person and with clear aim.  Thank you Steve.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is the most effective in monitoring the phone and all the apps a child can act like a fool in. I would recommend it to any parent needing insight into what their kid is doing on the phone and the control back with little fuss over it. Any bad review listed on here I guarantee you is a kid pissed that their parents care and have installed this app to protect them from social media and this crazy world we live in. Worth every penny.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is perfect for parents and is very affordable for anyone. I have not had any problems using this app. Thank you screen time for creating a great app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The service is flexible for multiple kids with different needs.  As a parent I can take a look at only the features that seem necessary.  The app and the website are easy to navigate.  Thanks.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app works really well and is very easy to use and set up. Only down side is the cost per month after the 14 day free trial - cost us almost $6 nzd a month. Not sure if we will keep going with it as it could end up very expensive over time,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's a but confusing at first but that's all. Everything else is great,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Easy to use, efficient and effective at managing everything I need to manage on my children's devices.  Allows for granular management of phone functionality for flexibility in locking and blocking some things while leaving others available, all while maintaining ease of use.  Highly reccomend!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is fantastic! Any bad review you read about it has been submitted by a kid who doesn't want the app on his phone. The reason? It works! The support for this app is fantastic as well. Very quick and helpful replies. The only issue is with cross platform adaptability. Specifically, when going from Android to Apple. It's not that it has problems working, simply that you cannot choose which apps specifically to block like you can when going from Android to Android. However, other than that, the app works flawlessly.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Really worth it. I will subscribe once the free trial ends because it does what I expect it to do, and more!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Do not piss off your kid too much with this or else a hole will be somewhere in your wall,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Bad,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is great! My child was spending too much time on his devices when I was away.  This lets me limit the use and he can earn more time which prompts my approval.  So happy I found this app!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has been wonderful for us as a family. It truly helps us manage our sons phone use together as a family. We get to discuss was is and isn't necessary and I love that I can see what app he is on at any moment. Great job!! Highly recommend.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Easy to manage. Nice to have the task function. Kids have accepted it.^^,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is an amazing tool. It has helped me tremendously and I don't blame kids for hating it. It takes their power away lol. Thank u for this App !!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I like it. It works as stated and isn't obtrusive to the cellphone as it is being used. Would like more detailed controls on hours each day vs only weekdays and weekends. Also needs ability to bank time from tasks to use on another instead of only on day earned.   Still a 5 star app but needs to be 5 plus!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,very good!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"While my kids originally didn't like it, they now just accept the time limits as part of their daily routine. This app is well worth the money, less screen time means more time outside, getting exercise and socializing with other actual human beings...in person   One feature i would like to see added is an alert every .time my kids log on and off their devices",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great way to incentivise and train kids to crate good habits eg bedtime, chores and being kind.  Easy to use. Quick responses from support team.  I like being able to create my own tasks so I can focus on positive behaviour as well as homework and other chores. My son hated it at first but talking with him about why I've installed it has really helped. We have much fewer arguments about screens now and good habits are beginning to become the norm. I really recommend this app. If you're still not convinced,  notice that the 5 star reviews are from parents and the 1 star reviews are from kids. That should be proof enough. Try the free trial period and see for yourself.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This App has worked better than any other app that we have tried :-) I have enjoyed the free 14 days premium. And will be looking into how much it will cost for a year subscription in NZ dollars :-) Thanks Screen Time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Easily removed from device by my daughter. This was 2nd time we tried to use the app, even paid, first time it did not track correctly. 2nd time was removed. Support are there for you, but not much they can do. Unless you have a very very  young child, I wouldn't recommend this app.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love the control I have over my son's phone while he is more than 1000km away in boarding school. He rings me more often to bargain more screen Time and puts in extra effort at school to earn it.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best time management I found.  Setting time limits for the kids is easy now.  kids hate it but that's the point..  I'll come back and give it 5 stars when they add function to limit time across multiple devices.  My daughter has already found out that the limit is per device so she will max it out and then move to the next device.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love that I can control the apps on Android devices but hate that I can't on Apple devices. But the kids don't seem to mind too much now that they are used it. But can you add a feature on the kids side so they can type a message on the tasks when asking for more time?,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome app. A must have if you have kids or teens on devices. Very easy to use and very effective.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We love this app! It is very functional.  I'm able to use this on multiple devices and it's very user friendly.  My son now knows he has a certain amount of screen time. He is a lot more thoughtful about how and when he uses it. I also like that they can earn more time, love it! I have a 10 & 7 year old and the transition has been smooth!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We love how we can now keep track of what our children are doing on their devices and how long they spend each day. The flexibility is great and we especially like being able to limit some apps such as games while allowing unlimited access to others like the overdrive app.  Hightly recommned!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is a great tool to get insight into kids activities on their phones. It gives conyrole pack to the parents. Yeha!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I like this app I have no problem,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is appsolutley wonderful. I have on my 13yo's tablet and it works wonderfully. I hid it so she can't find it and thanks to my Samsung Tablet's settings, she can't delete it either. It keeps a full record of her app, search, and and web history, even if she deleted her web history. We are currently on the free trial but it is well worth the few dollars every month.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Best parental control ap. I tried the others. They aren't near as good. I especially like the tasks that I can set up to give my child chores, which provide extra minutes. She does not want me to do her chores. She wants the extra time on her phone. Clean room, folded clothes, the dog always has water, the table is always set....and most of all...the family has an hour of no-phone family time....which of course racks up extra minutes for the child. No other ap does this much.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app for parents to observe their children on and makes me as a parent feel safe knowing my child has restrictions.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app to control electronic usage for your kids.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So far so good but difficult to include apps to be blocked. the switch icon is so difficult to drag.  and I found it literally impossible to drag the last app of all which I needed to block which is youtube.  why can't the buttons be more sensitive to touch?,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I think this app is great and my daughter had now become more aware of time and how to manage it. Although I have always limited the time with her manually this app enables me to monitor remotely which is brilliant. The only issue I have is the fact that I now have to pay for it. It someone produces an app like this for free that works just as well....i am going to jump ship.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good app. Worked with our two teenagers. Works 100%,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"A great idea, and well executed. Before installing, had a conversation with each kid (ages 10, 8, 6) about technology limits and why it's important to have them. Involved each of them in the process of determining what limits were appropriate and why. Result: no arguments about ""tablet time"" since.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app. I recommend that the developers add something that doesn't allow blocking or limiting time of certain apps. (i.e calling, texting, settings) You shouldnt allow disabling the calling or texting because emergencies might happen. You also shouldn't allow disabling the settings or else some unintended side-effects may occur. Many of which are not permitted on the Google Play Store. Thanks!",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's pretty easy to use. A few little thing to get used to, but they are nothing compared to the peace of mind knowing that I have control and the knowledge of what is happening on my kids tablets. I would HIGHLY recommend this app for any parents who either need to limit the excessive amount of time that their kids spend on electronics or parents who have curious youngsters and need to not only know what their kids are looking at and searching for, but also to be able to control which apps they have and how much access they have to the internet in general. A great app to ease your mind and make sure your kids aren't spending all their free time with their faces buried in a screen. Fantastic!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Pros for me: - daily summaries (via email) concerning apps and time used - can block installed apps by default - can block all app usage - allow time allotments per chore completed - real-time display of current app in use  Cons for me: - a bit pricey,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great way to incentivize​ good behavior and limit vice. Very decent parenting tool!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Really easy to use. Good addition to a parenting toolkit. We spent time discussing and agreeing limits first so it didn't seem like we were imposing it indiscriminately. My son would probably rather we didn't have this app but then I would rather he didn't have computer games & internet access 24/7 so it's a compromise.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The idea and the approach are good. You understand the challenges and needs.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My wife and I love it. We have 5 kids and it's hard enough trying to keep track of them all let alone what they are doing on their tablets. This app allows us to both monitor and restrict them before getting into any type of trouble. Plus it shows us what they are doing at any time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great way to set boundaries for my kids electronic usage. They now know that they have a daily limit and that they can't use their electronics until chores are done. All while I have the peace of mind that they aren't sneaking on.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I purchased this app and use it for a while without issues. Then suddenly it wouldn't work. Turns out that the app I bought now requires a subscription that costs a lot more for the same features I already paid for. I want my money back. App subscription are a rip off. Should still be a one time purchase (especially since that's what I was sold).,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Total control. Sometimes needed but more of a deterrent and leverage.  Can see if safe searches were carried out. Also can block apps individually.    Great.  Sorry kids but needs must sometimes. Join the real world once in a while!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very good app. Does what it sopose to do. There is one thing what I have found. First if you keep on auto block new aps then for some games it do not work. So if you kids like to install a lot of noew games then you should chek time to time are they all under controll.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app. Only app I have ever paid for! No more issues with the kids and getting them to put their phones away. I can control their screentime with a push of a button. Can review and block apps they are downloading and review their Web history.   Easy to use. I like that I can shut down  their phones down during school but still allow them to make calls or use what's app etc,5

If I need their attention I can pause play time and it gets their attention immediately! Keep up the great work!!,5

My daughter wasn't liking it so much when I first installed it, however, she is ok with it now. She likes being able to earn more screen time by helping with chores around the house.

The bed time blocker just locks the tablet up, no matter the time. The daily usage limit worked for the first day but on the second day it allowed my son to continue after it had expired. The time left simply said less than a minute even though it was twenty minutes over. This may be because the ""apps included in daily limit"" tab keeps reverting back to the off position no matter how many times I switch it on.  Like I said, a real shame because I would definitely had brought the pro version if it worked properly.",2

I've had the problem where I needed to call home, but the daily limit makes it so we can't call or text,the bedtime blocker and lights out make it so you can't call 911 at night if you have to,  it can cause(not necessarily all of us have this issue) violent outburst,and when data is being used, the app takes AT LEAST an hour to update All in all, I approve AND disapprove of this app",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is the fourth parental control app that I try and finally I am SO happy!!! It's the first one that actually works!!! It's very well designed and you have full control. There is even a feature to set tasks and give rewards. Great.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Too expensive. Have to pay a significant monthly charge. It does everything I want but it's not worth paying a regular recurrent monthly charge,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it! Great price? Glad I found it?,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Someone has learned that there is other stuff to do.  She has also learnt that there is a very short time frame between turning on the device and Screentime activation in which she is able to enable the media player.  Another challenge...still 5 stars love the reports.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a great app and worth the small monthly or yearly fee. If either of the kids act up, their phone is severly restricted just a few seconds later. Plus it is very granular. I can turn off everything but phone calls.  Or only allow or restrict by app.  Very nice job on the app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've just had an email telling me screen time is compromised. What use is the app if the kid can just disable it whenever they want? Not impressed.  Updated 5th March 2017 - when this app works properly, it's really good. Unfortunately it's far too flakey. I have contacted the developer, but that hasn't helped. If the flakeyness was solved, it would be a strong 4 star ,but as it is, it's a weak 1 star. Sorry. I certainly won't be continuing my subscription next year",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Ruins Child's phone. After a time the child's phone will start to get ruined because of this app,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Comprehensive. Well thought through.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Best parental control app, period (I've tried them all). Aside from the actual app being great, they fixed a billing issue right away and love feedback. They actually added a feature I really needed.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Although the app works it has its issues. If you send playtime it replaces any time earned and awarded for tasks completed. Also apps are inconsistently not added to the auto limited app list, so sometimes a child can install a new app or game and use it without limits. Lastly although support staff are responsive they seem able to do little to fix any issue.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Clarity excellent,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has taught my son currency and responsibilities. Earning time and not having electronics be the only way of life. He actually looks for things to do and does extra tasks to help us out without a fuss. It's like a game forgot him. He's 12, almost 13..and says himself he likes this app. Happy parents happy kid! Excellent development.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,App stopped working on both of my children's Kindles the other day. Still works on their phones. Emailed support and never got a reply. Looking at other options.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very effective! Love that I have the option to control my kids usage remotely...no more hassle when I ask them to get off their phones and they seem not to hear or comprehend.  Also love the fact that I can show them how much time they are actually spending on their devices.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Was a good app at the beginning. But since Android 6.0 it is too easy to remove the security....,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It took 5 minutes to be installed by my 10 yo. kid. You should revise your app.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's stable and offers a good set of features, all very well implemented, including daily allowance, banned apps,  apps allowed after bedtime (i.e Kindle) and then a lock down at lights out, plus tasks which earn the kids more minutes. Hopefully the developers will continue to add functionality as time goes on. I have tried quite a few of these parental apps and screentime seems the best to me.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"That app helps us not only restrict time spent on technology, but also to know what games the kids play and how they spend their time over the net. I already recommended the app to all my friends and colleagues!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The app is really good. The best one I've used so far and I've used alot. I like that you can see what apps being used in real time.  It's also easy to sync and install unlike some other apps.  My suggestion is that after blocking all apps that the block screen is auto shut not waiting for the child to click close as there may be no way of knowing the phone is no longer blocked and could be a frustrating double punishment.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So far I like it. The downside is using it  on apple devices.  All aops are blocked including mudic. It would be better if I could choose apps blocked.,4

Not only is it great to be able to set limits on screen time, it's a great tool to get chores done without arguing, either through the task button or hitting the pause button until it's done. Also being able to see my kids' search histories without having their device in hand is amazing! The only change I would like to see is a limit that covers all devices of one child. Currently if you set a 2hr limit if gives each device 2 hours instead of them sharing out of 1 2hr pool. Other than that I LOVE it and have recommended it to friends and family!",5

Excellent for enforcing bed and school time, but also works a treat when it takes someone 10 minutes to come down stairs....immediate results when the device is blocked! Very good example of actions and consequences.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I find this app very useful! Two things  I found difficult. When blocking an app button keeps switching to off state, so I have to do it several times to make it stick. Also, with the latest update, when adding photo from library I can only access recent photos, which is limiting my ability to choose the photo I want. Hope these can be improved! Thanks",4

I love that I can see what app she's using.  She even took my phone and unblocked the playstore on her phone so she could Uninstall the app. Unbeknownst to her, screen time sent us an email to alert us that this was done. She's grounded from her phone and I love the app even more. Worth every penny.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app, super helpful, very easy to use.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,great app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Good, not great app for limiting screen time. It mostly does a great job with monitoring app usage, however there do appear to be some limits to it. I watched my son use the YouTube app for over an hour yesterday and the usage was not updating on my phone. It showed the device as active but no apps being used. Even after he shut down the Youtube app it never showed as being used for the past hour plus. This doesn't happen often I don't think but seems to be trending more and more.   Pros:  Simple install Pretty straight forward controls and app limiting Configurable times  Cons: Not totally positive on if it gets the times right This is the biggest one for me, but it doesn't combine usage across multiple devices. So for instance, if you have a limit of two hours for your child, that will mean that they can use two hours on each device. My son figured this out after awhile and now uses two hours on one device then switches to the other for another couple of hours. Not a big deal if you are paying attention, but if they are home from school before you are home from work, this is something to be aware of.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very useful on Android but very flaky on Apple To the point that it is useless as it keeps locking out apps even during allowed times. Very frustrating for my son and me. I suspect that it may be down to the platform rather than the app but frustrating nevertheless. Subscription will be stopped now son has turned to the dark side for phone and tablet. Such a shame.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It was great until the update and then it stopped working and nobody can fix it!,2

But seriously, this is exactly what I was dreaming about -- a way to allow my child to hold onto his own device while I wordlessly control when and what he gets to do with it. It's so much better than yelling at it him to put down his device! No more fighting, just an objective set of rules that apply themselves.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app to control my kids Android apps. Being able to control what apps they can open and setting daily time limits give the me peace of mind and avoids the""can I watch more debate"". The only downside is that apps that run in the background, like audible audio books, can not be controlled. We have it set up for 1/2 hour on a weekday and 1.5 hours on the weekend. You can also set up wake up and bedtime hours. This changed our kids behavior as the used to get up at 5 am to watch screens.  We have just started to use the task feature where kids can earn more screen time by completing tasks. One example we use is that if they put away their backpacks and lunch bags, without being asked, they can earn an additional 5 minutes of screen time.  Overall very good app.",4

This has changed the way my children spend their time, and made tech time something they earn. My only suggestion would be to include a snow day/break button that I could easily toggle on certain days to eliminate the bedtime and school blocker controls.  Highly recommend this app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does not work,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The app is great. It allows me to monitor my kids phones and set limits. A few detailed features I would love to see is the ability to always have access to what's app because it costs me money to text my kids. So if you could choose not to block that on the iPhone settings that could be great and if you could choose daily time limits instead of just a weekday or weekend time limit would be awesome just like the daily bed time because I would rather allow my kids more phone time on Friday and Saturday instead of Saturday and Sunday. So being able to detail app limits on the iphone and detailed daily time limits would be great!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is great for monitoring my children. With 3 kids it is hard to stay on top of their electronics. This app makes it so much easier.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,A great app that make it easy to control or monitor what your kids are doing on phones and tablets.  Easy to set up and very flexible so you can change the restrictions or monitoring to fit the situation.  My kids hate it :-),5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Awesome app, easy to use, works so well. Has given us our happiness back!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Brilliant... In every way,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy way to manage my kids screentime. Really happy i downloaded this app!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app does what it says .I'm having trouble getting any internet history though .,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,ITS AWESOM BUT Plz add a way so we can control ho is calling them on whatsapp and viber... And be able to hear what they're talking about and see their text messages.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app! The bad reviews are from kids, who obviously hate it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Seriously awesome app. It has removed the problem of my kids sneaking into my room at 06:00 to get their tablets. It has made their time so precious that they don't waste it by looking up dodgy material (that was a shock to me and i was glad to nip that in the bud!). It has made them think of other things to do. I have exempted some educational apps and now they know how to fly planes (virtually of course! Haha!!) and learned about orbital mechanics of all things! This wouldn't happen if they sat all day playing rather stupid games which they would do if they had unlimited time. This app is a powerful tool with wide reaching, long lasting effects and helps your kids develop a healthy attitude to time spent on a screen. Lets face it, they are NOT going to be lawyers or surgeons after spending their youth with their head stuck in a screen playing videogames. Recently i unlocked my kids tablets because we had some big stuff happening. I still got the log at the end of each day and one of my kids spent eight solid hours playing on his tablet. There were a few minutes here and there for toilet and food breaks but otherwise it never stopped for the whole day. I don't care what anyone says, that's not good or healthy. Talking to him simply won't work so enter ScreenTime. Sorted!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is parents dream come true to monitoring your kids android devices. Beyond Excellent. It works with Ipads but with less controlling abilities.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I installed in on my son's tablet and it does everything I want it to. I highly recommend it!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It would be five stars if it worked on my daughter's Chromebook. I love all the one star ratings the kids leave - that speaks volumes about how good a product it is!  I like being able to control what apps she can use and when. She can do her chores, extra reading, and math to be rewarded with more internet time - which is very effective.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Screen time is a great parental aid that helps teach children moderation in the things they do.  A life lesson to help guide them on their journey through life.  I have worked closely with the Screen Time staff reporting bugs and suggesting enhancements and have found them helpful, and willing to listen to a parents suggestions.  While I can't claim my daughters ""love"" this app, my advice to parents is that this app is a great tool in a parents arsenal to teach moderation to their children.  Sometimes saying ""No"" means ""I love you"" .",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a great app, we use it on Android and an ipod.  We just use this to turn off apps at bedtime, and we monitor as a family how much time each one is on their device each day.  This way we have some idea of how much screen time is being consumed.  Works really great.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The fact that kids don't like it says something,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Good program when connected to WiFi, but not so well when using Mobile data.  We I grant time, increase playtime, or use the play; when on WiFi works great but when using mobile data it's spotty at best. Wish when I set play time it would include all devices as one, instead as each individual device.  As it stands now when I set a free time of 30 minutes, it would be 30 minutes on each device not 30 minutes total.  I like the feature to allow time after chores are done but wish I could take time away as easily.  All in all its a great program better than nothing at all.  Before this it was hard to control when my kids were lying to me about usage, now I can track it and catch them in their lies.  It's a great program, but with a few improvements it would be outstanding.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is the perfect remote tool. I love that I can use it from my device to control how much screen time my kids are using. It also let's you customize the features, like which apps they can access and internet history, which is a big plus. I recommend this app to anyone I know with kids. I'm very happy with it...... My kids don't like having this app and being limited, but if we didn't have it they'd be on their devices all day and night.",5

I also can control what apps they can use and when, I can block apps during school hours and bedtime, while still allowing those apps and telephone access that I want them to be able to use.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is a must have. My 10 year old stayed on his phone.  I would take it away from him during certain times so that he was more in the present with family.

We can limit the time they're online, take away apps that interfere with chores (snapchat, messenger, Instagram, etc.), stop apps that are inappropriate, watch what they're doing online and turn everything off when needed.

There is one feature I wish it had that it doesn't, but then again no other app has it either, and that is a setup where the internet is blocked except white listed sites.  The customer service seems to be good as I've asked a few questions in the app and they have all been answered. Thank you.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My son hates me for using this. Brilliant - just 4 days into the trial and he has been caught out twice.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It does exactly what it supposed to do. Well, I thought I can limit my kid's time on the phone, but I failed many times.  Intuitive and easy to use. To my surprise it encourages kids to help you with reward for completed tasks. Ability to exclude some apps from blocking is great too so that kids can make a call all the time.  Spoke with my daughter and she also ""hates"" it, so it definitely works!  Thank you very much!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,As a parent its an excellent app and Ive been using it for 3-4 years now. Ignore the bad reviews as they are mostly like put by the kids who naturally dislike it.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Provide control and oversight of your children's device usage. Should they be on Snapchat or Instagram for hours every day? That's a parental decision and this tool gives parents that positive control. I like that parents can create tasks (chores) for their children to earn extra screentime.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Kids will hate it but parents will love it.  It is super easy to use and it is a great app for parents to monitor their children's time on their electronics, keep them on task, and also control which apps they are not allowed to use such as social media or inappropriate games.  The only thing I wish it did better is when you tap on a sent task from your child's child's device such as ""please unblock _____ app"", it doesn't take you directly to the blocked apps (not really a big deal at all though)",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Of course kids are mad and leaving bad reviews.....this great app allows parents to be parents online and have a say in what their kids are doing with their devices. As a parent, I'm grateful that I can be halfway across the country and know that my teenager is making good choices with the device I provide for him. Bravo. Only complaint is the ease with which it is bypassed on iOS devices. Really more a complaint against Apple, though.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very well designed app. Leads to happier kids and parents when the balance is right.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app allows me to manage everything that I need done. It's cheaper than a cup of coffee and I use it everyday, it motivates my kids (3) to do chores and to go to bed on time, i have bedtime blocker taking care of apps that shouldn't be used at night and then school time blocker for apps that I dont want on during school, i have recommended this app to lots of parents who need this control over teens and preteens that are glued to their phone and need them to focus on homework, life, and family time AND dont want to constantly take their phone from them. With this, you just disable everything in one switch action and bam, phone is useless (except I always keep their phone, calculator, clock, GPS, enabled because I want them to be able to get help when needed). Hope this review helps, but I have had it now for 8 months or so and its well worth every cent.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app but didn't know about premium version before installing, seriously considering paying for it as it's such a useful tool however I feel it's a little pricey and to have to pay each month is a bit much, having said that I was surprised at how much I have used it.  I like how you can set kids chores for which they get extra tablet time. I have a son with undiagnosed behaviour issues and it's  a great for him. I love how you can set the bedtime and school time blocker to avoid any arguments and for free time such as a car journey etc. Plus it will tell you when your child logged on and off and when new apps have been installed. Overall a brilliant idea and well thought out but 4stars just because of the continuous subscription.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is an amazing program. I think everyone parent should have it on their child's devices. If screentime would hire me I'd go all over the world and teach parents about the safety and peace of mind of this app. I have 6 children and it has been a life saver.,5

It has made a huge difference as I can stop her using her phone late at night. I am sure my daughter would deny it, but I think that it has helped her control her addiction herself too.  There have been a couple of small glitches where the app has disappeared from her phone, but I have had advice from the people at Screen Time and the issues have been resolved.  Definitely worth the money.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love how easy it is to use. I work in the security field so privacy also comes up. I work with families and show them simple ways to monitor their families use of the internet. I recommend ScreenTime to any who are interested in their children and who love and care for their children.  To the parents who are overly concernced about what their kids think about ScreenTime: YOU ARE NOT WRONG FOR KNOWING what their children are being exposed to and for how long. Take control and be a parent. This is a great tool and so far the best I've seen to help you do that.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Perfect,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Has been a great tool for keeping electronics use in check. My tweens don't like it, but I'm very happy with it.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Best Cross Platform Tool for Electronic Usage Management. I've tried 6 or 8 of these apps here on Google Play and this one hands down has the BEST functionality, is the most user-friendly and allows parents almost complete oversight with respect to usage time, sites visited, and overall regulation. As a parent, I want control over how much time my 3 kids have online (btw that equals 6 devices since each had a phone & tablet). I also want control of when they start online & when its time for electronics to be off.  I have the ability now to disable everything when I need them quick (running, late, school bus or dinner time). I want them off at night, at bedtime & while in school.  I have this control as well as the functionality to increase time, reward them with even more time and so much more.  Best of all here other than the app of course is the Tech Team....professional, prompt, understanding, hard working & listen to our concerns (really listen). Inquires are responded to usually within an hour or two & they walk you thru every step.  Try it once & you'll never understand how you lived without it.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has been a life saver for our family. Before it, we would have to yell at the kids to get off their tablets when they spent too much time on it.  This app eliminates that problem and helps the kids moderate their time on their tablets.  I also love that we can exclude apps from the time limit.  So much customization with the Android version, unfortunately you don't get that with IOS version  (have one kid on an iPhone)",5

I briefly explained what my son could expect day one and that afternoon, without being asked, he began to set the dinner table. This was one of the custom ""bonus time"" rewards I'd set up the night before. They are really great kids already. This app just helps bring it out more easily. It's also rewarding us with more time together at the end of the day. Thanks ScreenTime.  I'd just like to see similar offerings for home networks, game consoles, PC and apple devices as well so that I can unify time limits and management.",4

Kids are older but still needed. Better time controls needed (varying throughout day would be better) plus I don't like not letting him.have access to the phone app if he needs it, would love an always on feature",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Major improvements over time. Still some mechanisms to bypass controls especially if an app is already running. A great next step would be to link it to Windows 10 parental control to create a holistic view across all devices in the house.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's great,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've used this app for 2 years now. Last year I upgraded to the full version. WORTH EVERY CENT.  I love that I can set time limits, or shut her phone down at bed time, or during school. With a click of a button I can turn all the blockers off for school holiday or for summer.  If she does extra chores, she's rewarded with more screen time. Needless to say, I don't have to ask her to clean the bathroom or feed the dogs. We have Galaxy phones. My son has an iPhone, it doesn't really work on his. At least, not that I can figure out.",5

Thanks for making my life easier!!!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"With this, I have managed to get my child's phone addiction under control. She grudgingly accepts it as the alternative was reprogramming the phone with a club hammer. She has a time allowance which can be topped up by doing set tasks. The only thing missing is time subtraction for not doing mandatory chores but that will come soon I hope.  Apparently there have been several annoyed children who have given bad reviews, which is vindication of how well the system works and how good it is.",5

We discuss what apps need to be available even when her screen time is up for the day.  If you use it to punish your kids they probably won't like it. If you use it to teach, raise awareness, and have conversations, they probably won't mind it.   The app is great.  She really likes that she can  earn more time by doing things we agree upon. E.g. cleaning her room or doing something nice for someone. Again we discuss and agree on the actions that can earn more time.    Great app!   Thanks for making it",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app would recommend to all parents with kids that has phones,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a parent, this app solved several problems in my house without having to completely take away my 12 yr olds phone. It helps me keep him safe online, & let's me keep tabs on what he's doing.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I absolutely love this app. It has been an absolute god sent. It changed our lives as a family. My daughter no longer fights for the tablet and is much better about doing chores and such for more time . I can see everything she does on any of her devices down to what sites shes been on and when. I can set limits on time and prevent her from using the apps that I can't remove from the device (ie facebook or google hangout). She loves that I can send her messages. Makes her feel like she is getting texts. She was upset at first but quickly became use to it after about 1 week. I highly recommend this app for all parents who have devices for their children. I wish they had an app for smart tv's!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"After we started the trial my daughter came to us & cried, I hate it! It won't let me watch my shows! Yup! It works!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Served it's purpose! First app of this kind I've used so I have nothing to compare it to. Worked well for the time I had it and then the free membership ended. Still deciding if I'll keep it for a monthly fee.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is the BEST app ever created to monitor my kids! Easy to use and very affordable.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Good attempt, there are 5 to 60 second or longer delays in the app taking control at times, it doesn't monitor all activity, widgets aren't monitored, no web browsing monitoring even though it says it on their website and in the app. ""we are working on it"" Well don't mislead your customers by saying you do.  It does app lockdown and remote lock/unlock. Decent time controls, but they still have a lot of work to do.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is an awesome tool for parents to help keep kids on track with their priorities,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Beyond amazing! Moniters, limits, rewards as I need it too. And when I had a concern they got back to me so quickly and helped me work through the issues. Recommend over and over!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has been very effective with my daughter in limiting her reliance on the phone and reducing the usage to a reasonable amount. It allows me to monitor without needing to be overly obtrusive and she feels a measure of privacy still despite me being able to monitor.  Favorite was on the first night when she promised to turn it off at bedtime and didn't know about the app yet. Two minutes after bedtime she yells down and was mad bc it locked her phone. I calmly pointed out it was past bedtime and there was no more argument. Would highly recommend this!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Totally frustrating, stopped logging browser & app usage after two days, my kid, who is no wizz kid managed to uninstall it - without the password, cos the only place I store it is my head! Mediocre at best.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is also great to limit yourself, if you have issues with phone time or content. Give the password and account to a trusted person in your life (or two, for back-up), and tell help them set it up, telling them what you trust yourself with. The person I am doing this for really loves it and feels safer using a smart phone now. One suggestion- it would be awesome to have the ability to put different time limits on different apps. Anyway, thanks for designing this! I am so using this to keep my kids safe from harmful content online when I am a mom!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It blocks my son's phone form using it,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is the best app ever!! I have tried a number a parent control apps this one by far is the best and easiest app ever made. You are able to control what games your kids download if you don't want to plan it you can block it you got time control for school for home bedtime by far best app ever thank you for making this app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I purchased this app to manage my kids Android tablet time without hovering over them constantly.   It allows for individual blocking of apps across specific time and even a reward system for tasks completed. Time on electronics is like currency for kids these days and I needed something that allowed my son to read, but also restrict his time in all the time killing games.   When you first install the app, you are given a week of unlimited access to everything the program has to offer. After the week is up, you still have basic access to control things. I wasted no time purchasing once the trial was up.  I would recommend this app to anyone who would like to manage their children's screen time and activities.   If you're wondering how well this app works, there are 2000+ one star reviews, the vast majority of which are from kids very upset that their parents have this time management tool on their systems.   We cant be looking over their shoulders all the time. Thankfully, with this, we don't have to.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app was exactly what we needed to help reduce and monitor our son's screen time. Since we have limited his time with this app, it has indirectly taught our son how to manage his time. We love the feature  that allows him to earn extra screen time and to lose extra screen time. It has been a huge help in getting him to remember to do what he needs to do. He hated this app at first but has come to accept it. With limited screen time, he talks to us more and is more active instead of having his face in his phone all of the time. Honestly, I think he is a happier kid with less screen time. I have already recommended this app to several of my student's parents.",5

Don't listen to them. This app gives me Peace of mind",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"While this app night not be a kids best friend, so they will think now, its ability to help monitor your kid screen time is priceless. Growing research talks about the harmful effects too much tech time can have on developing mind.

Best tool I've found so far besides the powerful word no.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I liked the app. Very useful. It can be a bit delayed at times but not always. Also I just didn't wana pay to continue using but that's just me being cheap.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We have 4 kids with who use their tablets for school. The schoolteacher blocker, coupled with a restricted browser means only educational apps are available during school.  The pause/play feature is great if you need to make them take a break or add time for a specific reason.  I would like to be able to set days in the school blocker, just because we do school 7 days a week, but this is still a great program for the price.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,AWESOME!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very easy to install and set up multiple users and devices.  I like it that I can set it so they can still call select numbers even after bedtime activated.  This feature should have its own toggle. Much easier than remembering to collect their phones at night.  It's a good tool to teach some self monitoring as well with  time limits.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We have 7 kids and each has at least 1 device. It's easy to imagine how easily the children learned to use them to control our lives. Additionally, we homeschool, and they use their tablets to access much of their material. Screen Time has allowed us to take back our lives, get Chores done, make bedtime actually time for bed and keep them focused on their schoolwork. We are huge fans and advocates of the Screen Time app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app my son can't take it off and he knows when it shuts off its not coming back on and doesn't argue half as much I have recommended this to a few of my friends and family.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Fabulous app. I have my daughter back at last!!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app!! Great tool for managing how much time your kids spend on their devices  At first some friction so I had to gradually introduce but it's really helped cut down on conflict.  I only wish they had windows 10 support!!   Nothing else I found gave the ability to limit time on some apps but continue to allow access  plus other apps like net nanny were too easily thwarted by my tech say son  ps.  Don't try to find all in one - get k9 Web separately for content filtering,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app... I love that I can see exactly what my kids have been doing on their tablets, set bedtime hours and hours just for reading.  The kids love it because it lets them know when they can play and when they should be reading or sleeping.  Well with the cost.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app!!!  There is no more downloading inappropriate apps unless if I OK it!!!   I love that you can limit there app usage!!!   You can set it were their phones turn off for bedtime & turn back on in the morning!!!  The kids get 1 hour of game time on weekdays & 2 hours on weekends!!!  There is now more family time instead of kids glued to there phones!!!   Most parents should monitor the kids phones or tablets, but the don't because the are to lazy to check!!!  My kids are starting to like this app.  At first they hated it but in time they love it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It really gives you control over what the tablet is being used for. Yes the kids are not thrilled, but as a parent it's nice to be able to have some control over their electronic behavior",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I would give it 4 stars but if the kids are smarts and the parents dont know they will download parallel space apo and clone the block apps giving them access to the apps they cant use...like the Internet browser...so watch out parents,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app . Exactly what I was looking for. Have 3 kids aged 7 , 8 and 11 and it was a nightmare trying to keep them off their device.  Now they use up their time over the course of the day and have trained themselves not to need to have it all their spare time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It does what its says on the tin. Absolutely live it. I can track what my daughter does on her tablet. I can limit the time how much she can use, reward her with additional time. So its perfect.  I guess she is not enjoying as much as i do.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Don't search anymore. This is the one.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has put an end to the arguments & my parental guilt! (Let's face it...we all have it. None of us are perfect). The ability to see what my child is seeing at the touch of a button, really does put my mind at ease.  The use of tasks has redefined the way my 9yr old son thinks about his tablet use & instead of pocket money for chores he has tablet time. This usually consists of tidying room, exercise, homework, doing something kind and even brushing his teeth. With added task time he is still limited to less than 2hrs a day screen use - this includes t.v. We now spend much more quality time together having fun instead of him sulking because he can't use the tablet.  Most definitely recommend this app.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've looked at other similar apps, but this one is the best by far. It takes the frustration out of trying to monitor my kids usage of their devices. They also take suggestions, I like the open thinking of the development team. Get this app if your kids are on their devices too much.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It does not work... for some reason it  wouldn't block the apps and I would get accused for it!,1

It has everything I've ever needed to put limits on my daughters phone without me having to be a broken record, or get into arguments about. Just set it up and it takes care of itself.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is so bad I can never use my phone,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Best App EVER! I was initially interested in limiting screen time, which is hard with one kid but super time consuming wth three. I also wanted some parental controls to manage access & content. What I hadn't predicted was that it has also been the best behavior modification tracker/reward system I could've asked for! The kids are doing chores & going out of their way to do acts of kindness to earn additional screen time for customized tasks that are important to me! I have personally recommended this to at least a dozen of my friends & have been gushing on FB about my excitement! Great job app guys & gals, you rocked this one! My only concern at this point is that shared time between each child's devices would streamline things even more perfectly!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app..kids not doing homework pause, spending to much time on online and not enough physical activity limit their time. Rooms have never been cleaner and chores are always done.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is the only app I found that is able to limit screen time! Most apps around limiting access are dealing with security and safe browsing, this here is specifically for limiting access to applications during certain hours or granting access for a limited time. It does a great job and it is fairly easy to use. Only 4 stars instead of 5 because of occasional glitches that I couldn't solve yet. Has to be installed with developer rights which makes it harder (not impossible) to uninstall, but go figure.:-)",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I allowed my niece to use line application all the time to keep in touch with her. and she found that while the phone waslocked by your app. she still can surf internet and youtube chanel via this app by just simply type url address in any chat with whoever and the url will become the link that can bring her to the web browser through line application. Possible to fix this? I really don't want to block line application on my niece's phone.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent to monitor and adjust usage from day to day.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,After the initial fuss from the kids about the app it is now having a great influence.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"If you do this to a teen.. you're just asking for them to lose any ounce of respect towards you. At that age it's all about trust. You have to trust that your teen will use their phone for the right reasoning. This app might solve the issue of amount of phone usage. Although, if you do this to a teen, you're creating worst conflicts; such as breaking their trust in you and losing their respect. Who am I you're probably asking? Of course, I'm the teen whos the victim of this app. So of course you're probably thinking this is a biased review. But listen to this.. I still love my parents. Do I respect them? No. Now answer me this.. what greater failure in life is there.. then to lose your children's respect? How bout you try and talk to them about your phone usage first , see if they'll make a change for you first; then go from there.Think twice before you install such a helicopter app on your TEENS phone. People say you can't change a person.. what makes you think this app will change your teen? It'll only bring anger and confusion as to why you would do such a thing to them; why would you commit such an act of betrayal? I understand there's teens who need to get their head straight. But for those like me who are focused in school and a well rounded kid, I feel all you need to do is talk to them about their phone usage. I certainly would have made a change in my life to limit my phone usage , but I wasn't given a warning.. I was quickly bombarded with all these restrictions. I pretend I'm happy , I pretend I'm cool with the app, my parents think we're fine.. which is good right?.. except for the fact that I don't trust them anymore - I don't respect them anymore - I certainly cannot wait to be get out of their care. Also.. if you're dealing with a teen, they're gonna figure out loopholes.. I have :-) also.. @screentimestaff. If you have any ounce of respect for your customers, you best put this review on your website; at least the part that warns parents of the possibility of losing such a bond with your teen. If not? Well.. good job. You've destroyed my perspective towards my parents. You've destroyed my parents wanting to bond with me. You've destroyed 1 family. Try and give other family's a warning now..",3

Also, if you are looking to monitor texts and such this program is not set up for that.  However, it is great for making sure they can't use their phones when you don't want them to.  Overall a great program.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a great app, although I feel it is still a bit glitchy.  We upgraded to Premium (I definitely recommend!) but sometimes the approved tasks don't show up on my kid's device.  However, their tech support is incredibly helpful, and the features are great.  My kid would give this app zero stars, but that frustration used to be directed at me.  Since we installed it, she does chores without arguments, and she is learning to use her screen time wisely, which is something we all could probably learn to do...",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app, and only a couple of issues. Be aware of using cache cleaning software whilst using it. They lose your connection to your kids devices so they become unlocked. Other issue is that when you make a change, such as the length of time, wait for it to update as if you do the change and come out within seconds it doesn't update across all devices. Genuinely a good product and the kids have just accepted it now. Suddenly find they are both ready to play real games at the same time now.. Not one badgering the other while they are catching up on YouTube etc...",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I did what it said but it still is on my child's phone. Do I have to factory reset it? Even when the Devs read my comment they were so unobservant that they called me Josh. My name is Robert!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The first app I have ever been willing to pay for. It truly let me monitor and control my children's screen time. I like that I can approve different apps for different children and keep some apps available even after the time has expired for the day--so they can still access the camera, calculator, flashlight and such. I have been stay at home for 20 years and only recently returned to the workforce. The loss of control over devices was driving me crazy. Most parental controls I tried didn't take long for them to work around. This finally put me back in control.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a wonderful app for parents.  Solves the issue with bedtimes and tantrums.  One more tool in the parenting toolbox.  The only thing I'd change is to allow kids to power off the device after lockdown at ""bedtime"" for example, but that's not critical.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app!! I have control over my daughter's phone and know what she's up to. She's not happy but I definitely am!!,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So far it seems to be working as promised,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app. I paid for the service for the year. It's well worth it. It has solved the problem of hiding and losing phones. It took along while to get my 14yr old on board with it. He tried all avenues to remove it.  But we persevered by taking his phone away until he agreed with the restrictions. When my kids go to other houses we can turn off certain apps late at night. Great invention, As kids are addicted to social media and phone apps. Some parents too for that matter.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I like the app in general, its features are exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately it's way too easy for a child to ""kill"" the app, circumventing the whole system. I understand this is standard Android behavior, but it kinda defeats the purpose. :(",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great for tracking time on apps.  Doesn't do any filtering or tracking of time on websites.  It does have a chrome only web history but wish it had the ability to track time spent and blocking of specific websites.  Still looking for a compatible solution.  I also wished it had a time bank of unused time so it wasn't use it or lose it on time.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app is very well designed and the support is almost instant, my only complaints go towards a somewhat rigid approach in terms of feature requests and a strangely convoluted payment system (Why subscription? Why not allow paying via Google Play?)",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is a work of pure genius! The fee to upgrade to premium is well worth the cost to save us from daily battles over screens. My son was getting up earlier and earlier (before we were even up) to play video games, which of course made him crankier and crankier. With the Bedtime Blocker he knows it's pointless to try. I love the Play/Pause function when he's not coming to the table for meals, and assigning tasks to earn extra screen time has definitely increased his cooperation around the house. He may not like it, and had asked for us to uninstall it numerous times, but overall it has made a WORLD of difference in a good way in our home!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to use,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app.  Definitely worth the money so far.  Have been using for just over a month.  My daughter complained at first, but has quickly got used to it and we don't have to get into that nagging cycle any more.  I like that it's flexible and quick to turn controls on and off or change the time limits.  I also like being able to control at app level, so that I can give her more time on the apps that I feel are better for her than others!  I think it's helping her to be more aware of the time.  She plans her day now around times that she knows she can have screentime... and actually isn't always choosing that option.  The daily reports are useful and a good way to talk about whether 4 hours on YouTube was the best way to spend the day.  I like that she can earn extra screentime by doing tasks that she chooses from a list we've set.  She did this a lot at first but less now, so maybe we've got the balance about right.  I'd definitely recommend giving it a go and the trial period is long enough to give it a good test out.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very good. My kids went nuts the first time they were blocked. Now after showing them the tasks they can do to get extra time they are both doing chores and their homework?!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Amazing app.  Completely have full control over my sisters phone and my mum can control the phone also from her phone. And it's also cheap,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app, my daughter dislikes it, but not as much as I thought she would.  The tasks are a great feature, we have added a lot of tasks that she can choose to do to get more time, which she actually finds interesting, like a game.    Also, I love that I can limit by app rather than a wholesale limit (Android only as of now but that works for me).  This allows me to allow her to listen to her music (for example) while she does her homework without taking away from her total time.  The potential for future improvement and possibly linking to a child's school is interesting as well.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. My kids hate it.  It sets limits and boundaries.  I don't have to worry  about what my kids are doing at school on their devices.  IT also helps with your kids arguing with parents. If you want lights out at 9 pm. The phone closes and says good night whether the child likes it or not.  All controlled  by the parents phone. I have recommended this app to all my family and friends. It is worth every penny.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app.  You can adjust the setting anytime or extend shut down time on the fly.  I dont need to ask my kid to stop using her tablet anymore this app does the talking for me.  Now my daughter is dicipled and does not take for granted the time she gets to spend on her tablet.  She hates the time limit and even wrote an essay for school about it saying its the only rule she would like to change at home.  lol,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Gem of an app for parents.  Yes, the UI is a little dated, and where is the material design?  Don't let that stop you from installing it though. It has worked great (for 6 year old) to encourage unlimited daytime use of educational apps while limiting time on other apps.  Dev suggestion: I do wish there was more than 1 category of time limited apps. For example, enable 1 hour Netflix, and 30 minutes of other games.",4

I love the app and the service,  but hate apples way they work things.  I will be getting my daughter an android device so I have better control over apps she can use.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app.  I talked to my son first around why we were installing this on his phone (important).  The limiting of apps allows him to use the phone as a technology tool, without the distractions of games during school time.  It shuts him down at a specific time of night so he can get a decent nights rest...and it allows me to stop having to patrol what he is doing with his phone as I get regular emails and can always manually check where he has been. My only issue is the iphone for my daughter.  Does not seem to work as well as it does on the pixel.  I am still giving the app a 5 star as I really purchased it for my son, who seems to be like most boys, and is far more addicted to games than my older daughter.",5

Not okay!!  We'll see if it improves, I bought the whole year already. Update: he's found a way around the bedtime blocker. If he's on a regular call, it won't kick him off.

Being able to pause their phone is great for encouraging them to do theirs chores before they can play again. Bad reviews very likely from kids since they are on the receiving end of this great tool.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Amazing...  We have 3 boys varying in age and its so flexible so that my eldest feels we aren't controlling too much and for our middle boy who is Autistic (demand avoidance + other asd conditions) we can control when he's allowed certain apps and the device is the 'one' imposing the restrictions not us.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,If I could give it 10 stars I would. It's such a great app to help monitor and control what your children do and see on their phones or tablets.

We previously used AppLocker, but that didn't limit the amount of time on the device. The only complaint that I have is that the kids can still go in to safe mode and get around the restrictions.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app for controlling and monitoring your kids usage of their devices and the Internet.  After the 2 weeks free trial we were left in no doubt that the £30 per year us money well spent.   The ability to set which apps work when and which are time limited means the Kids can always may a call or send a text to us, even when they've used up their time for the day.  School time and lights out mean it's easy to set when their devices are off limits and the tasks from function is a great method of positive reinforcement as well as meaning jobs round the house get done...   Thoroughly recommend this to any parents who are worried about their kids usage of electronics, or those that don't want to have to worry!",5

We also will be canceling our family $5 a month with our carrier because this app basically does everything for cheaper. Can't recommend it enough. Just wish there was an option to add more blocked of times. Like add a scheduled block time for Sunday's during church, like there is already an option for blocked school hours. Maybe there is a way, I just haven't figured it out yet.  **Updated** sadly my kids have found a way to get around using up their final minute. So it extends out their time by just constantly open and closing out the app.",3

However I do wish their were a few more options like blocking content by rating. Yes I can block whole apps but I rather choose ratings and have a profanity filter as well. Otherwise it's done the trick rather nicely, especially having the option for them to request more time if they do certain tasks.

I know I can check what has been searched and do this daily but I'd rather the attempt be blocked completely.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I am loving this app.  It gives me the control I need for my two children, ages 12 and 10.  My 12 year old is pretty responsible so there is not much need to limit the apps, but it's great because I can limit his usage by blocking school and bedtime hours.  So no staying up late or getting up in the middle of the night to play.  During school hours he can message and call, but no game apps!  I like that!  One other thing that is really cool is the ability to add extra time by assigning tasks that allow kids extra phone time.  One tip I learned and it's kind of funny... Always log out when you are done.  My son decided to change his usage to 20 hours per day!  HAHA!  Nice try!  Once I realized he was doing it (crazy kid didn't change his sister's hours, so I know it was him) I learned to log off each time I'm in.  During sports season, he has no availability to apps unless he asks and then I can allow him to play for whatever time I chose.  This app is very flexible and can meet the needs of any parent, strict or lenient.  I would give it 5 stars, but I never give the highest mark because there is always room for improvement!!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Update: this app does NOT work well with Apple products at all. You have to add a ""glitchy"" app to keep all your child's apps from being removed from their folders and rearranged every time the phone is being blocked. It also installs a VPN which cannot be shut off and constantly reconnects itself which in turn blocks the apps. I spent more time troubleshooting the app and trying to unblock my kids phones than I would have personally monitoring the time spent on each phone myself. For Android, it works great, worth every penny. Apple, NO, don't do it.  This has been a great app for our family!

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I think this is a wonderful app. I am able to monitor my kids tablet and phone usage and limit it if needed. And it takes the argument out of it because it just kicks in and I dont have to take the item physically. My kids were displeased at first but have gotten used to the boiundries this helped me set for them. They can also earn more time if they run low. I can set bedtime and block individual apps. This has become an important tool as a parent. I would reccomend this to any parent. If you see bad reviews, its from displeased kids, which means its working.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works as expected like the interactive part of it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great App. Lets me know what the kids are doing; can add time for tasks and good behavior.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,thank you screen time,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Fantastic app helps a lot,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,its good just made me learn simple hacking like this could become a spy ware,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Efficient,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app leverages a great idea, and *almost* implements it pretty well. I have had a lot of trouble, but it may be at least partly the fault of a very old and tired Nexus 7 (2012) trying to run the latest software. The good news is that commenting within the app produced a very quick response. So, it seems like customer service is a high priority with this developer.  As of right now, this app is still not working on my tablet, but I haven't spent too much time trying to figure it out. Will reinstall tonight.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is the best APP ever for being a parent. I love that I can make my sons tablet turn off at a bedtime I pick so I dont have to worry he will stay up. I also am able to block him from his favorite APPs from my phone if he is not behaving which is a big plus for me. Love this APP!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Needs some kind of call/txt tracker so can see who my child is in contact with. Also need to be able to adjust school time blocker as my daughter uses her phone for Homework during lunch time.  Otherwise a fab app,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best parental control app I've found for Android. The kids haven't been able to get around it without my knowing. Keep up the good work!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is great for my 6 and 9 year old tablets. It gives me easier control.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has completely removed the argument about screen time between my eleven year old and me. The premium is worth every penny.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love it. My son would delete it if he could. Lol. It allows me to but a limit as to when and for how long he can play his games. He is still able to text and call in case of emergence even after his daily limit. I can also check what's games he is playing anytime I need to. If I need him to do something ASAP I can pause his usage until his task is finished.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It really helped me. I'm the child and I spend way to much time on my phone. This helps me stay in tree real world.  I have started hanging out with my family more,  and I love it!!!! Sure not getting to use my apps was annoying a lot of the time,  but i think it was worth it. If your a patent installing this app on your child's phone may not only help you know what they're doing and how long their doing it.  It could also help your child lube life to the fullest",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a parent I love this app, the kids age 9,aren't too happy about it though because it's extremely simple yet effective,  their tablet time is under control and I no longer have to be confiscating their tablets.  I can limit/block things like games etc while still have access to the apps that they need for homework like spelling and times tables apps.  Love it,  just what we needed.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Gud,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I LOVE this app. My daughter was spending way too much time on her tablet. Now I can control the time limit, set curfews, and see what she is doing online. It also updates me when she installs something new. Another thing that I love, it lets me send her messages and approve extra time in exchange for chores.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is the best app I've ever installed. Even our kids love it! We talked about whether more screen time would make them happier or better people, and they agreed that the answer would be no. Since installing screen time, they still have access to their device, and Mom is in a much better mood, without always having to tell them to turn off their devices.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The bad reviews are only from kids which means this app does it's job perfectly!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I really love this app, now that I understand how to use it. It was difficult to understand at first because I didn't really know what I was doing. The technical help was not helpful. I asked for someone to please call me but that didn't happen. I basically figured it out on my own. Once I got past that the ability to control my kids phone is truly amazing. It is nice to be able to just push a button and, Bing, the phone is locked. I would say technical support would be a great plus for this app.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"In theory the app is great, I can set limits easily and see exactly what apps are being used and for how long.   The downside is I can't set a combined limit, ie one hour of usage across all devices. I set an hour per day plus chores, but that ends up being per device, the tablet gets an hr and the phone gets an hr.  In general I don't care which device is used, but I want the total to be an hr. It can't do that. I called support, and the work around really isn't great. But I'll keep using it because despite the limit issue, because otherwise it works fine and is relatively easy to use.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Help me keep me teenager safe from downloading inappropriate apps. Allows me to monitor what he spends most of his time doing when he says he is doing homework in his room. I have the power to pause the device at any moment and for specific times. It works amazingly.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Screen time has been an awesome tool in our home. it has stopped arguments over turning off tables.  My kids have been very open to it and haven't complained at all.  The boundaries it has provided have been a win all around.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"So dissapointed. Within 5 min of lock kicking in,  my eight year old has deleted the application from her desktop and is playing on again. Laughing at me as my app was easy to get rid of. How is that even possible? I am really impressed with the features on this app,  but what is the use if it doesn't even work?",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love it! I can keep an eye on my 12 year old twin boys.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Your kid can drag and drop this up on bin and delete the app without any request of a password,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is brilliant, my kids didn't approve, but we needed to do something as they had no self control, despite many conversations about limiting the time they spent on their devices.   We have recommended to many of our friends and I am sure their children will never talk to us again :) but at least their parents will be happy they have their children back.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app! I only have small children, but it still helps! It shuts off and they go and do other things. my oldest gets more time when he gets his chores, homework and piano practice done.  My 3 year old loves to be in front of the computer or tv and this helps me control his time in front of all of that. Since i have installed this on his device, when it shuts off he doesn't cry or scream like he did when i had to physically take it away. It it so much easier now he just sets it down or brings it to me and goes off and does something else.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app doesn't work and makes my kids extremely crappy.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a good app for my teenager , I used another app before that didn't work! My daugther was able to get around different blocks, but this one works much better and she is not able to do so!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very helpful and easy to customize!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Kids know how much time they have, and when they can use it so they learn fine management. Far fewer arguments as a result and we don't have to keep an eye on the clock and be constantly enforcing limits.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We dont fight about electronics!! Wonderful,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great application if you want to have total control on how your kids use their mobile devices. Has many more features than you even might think of. Definitely worth the price for peace of mind when your kid is not with you but with his/her mobile device.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Blocked apps when it shouldn't. Caused more of a headache. I'm going back to secure teen which is a much better product.,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Its perfect,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is a great pranker,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Both myself and my kids love this app.have seen some negative reviews left about not being able to do anything but we haven't found any limitations other than the time limit set by me.great control for me and the kids love earning more time through tasks.looking forward to shared time over devices in future updates and hopefully there will be an option for the kids to save up their earned time if they can't use it that day.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Best app I could download.  Able to set up rules (how much they are on and what they can do) and then let the kids have their FREEDOM to do what they want, when they want - as long as it fits within my rules.  Once their time is up, the app shuts their device down.  Rules are clear, time is up, no fights with Dad...the app is the bad guy.    Love the detail reports and ability to ""pause"" their system at the touch of a button.  Daily reports are great to talk with my kids about where their time is going.  Great job Screen Time team!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I got this app for my younger siblings and I really like it. I get to see all their activity and I'm able to have full control over it. Finally they can enjoy life without killing their time on electronics,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have a 9 year old son who loves his using android products.  It has been a constant battle with how much time he spends on the devices. This app has helped more than I can say!!! I am one happy parent. My son on the other hand, really dislikes the app. I figure that proves it is doing the job it is meant to do.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love that I can see what my kids are doing, limit screen time and pause when needed. Also helpful that I can still allow access to apps I don't want limits on.   Suggestions: give kids a 5 and 1 minute warning before it shuts down.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is great for a busy mom of 3 daughters 13, 11 and 9.  The bed time blocker is the BEST!  and I love that I can include or exclude certain apps in their daily limit. Its well worth the money to our family!!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Exellent for kids who have too much screen time and for parents who want to limit their kids screen time but can't get them off their tablets, ipads, ipods or iphones.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Awesome app, thumbs up the creators. Very helpful to parents while introducing handphone to kids and montior the activites with oeace of mind.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Absolutely worth  every  bit of the premium  after your trial to avoid the constant conflict  and teach our children responsible web usage.  Not only does it allow me  to protect them and monitor what they're learning but it also gives them incentives and rewards based on good performance. You know it works when they come asking you to create more task for them to do! We had to learn to dial down our limits to help them see better time management and to have rewards to reap. You wouldn't leave your home unprotected or allow strangers to walk about with your children so why wouldn't you want to provide this as a tool?  My favorite part is that it stops the arguing between parent and child in a lose-lose situation.   No doubt the fact that it puts a kid in an uproar in their limited reviews should be proof enough to tell you how effective this app is!  THANK-YOU SMART WEBBY PEOPLE, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Fab app best ever,  we're have you been all my life. Kids value there time more on the ipads and we have had no complaints from them as yet. Love it what a great app.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Must have app!!!!!!!!!! If your children use tablets or phones this is pure heavenl, I use it on an Apple iPad, Acer tab, Samsung tab and assorted phones, this works flawlessly and allows you as a parent to completely control the time, apps and functionality of your child's device, from when they can use it to what the can use and why, I was looking for a cross platform app to do exactly what this does and would highly recommend this to anyone.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Saves us tons of arguments,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have this installed on my daughters phone.  I have 2 daughters (8yo/11yo) who both share a smartphone.    They don't complain and understand why Dad installed this app on their phone.  I'm a huge believer in talking with your kids and being honest.  I honestly told them that the world wide web is a wonderful and exciting ""place"" but that a few bad apples can spoil the web experience pretty easily.    Love the app blocking, the time limits you can put on it and the daily activity reports that are sent.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Well let me just start off by saying that in the world we live in today we NEED to keep an eye on our Children and their every day activities online. This app helps you monitor/block what you child does. Sets time limits and a bed time blocker. Theirs plenty of mindless teens on their phone all day and I refuse to let my children join the trend. BOTTOM LINE THIS WORKS AND FOR THE PRICE YOU GET A GREAT APP BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY YOU GET THE PIECE OF MIND KNOWING WHAT YOU CHILD IS SPENDING THEIR TIME ON.     P.S. YOUR CHILD WILL HATE YOU AND IT FOR THIS 😂👌,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a very good quality, well thought out app. It has enabled me to take control of my son's tablet. He is a lot more responsive when i ask him to shut it off for dinner since he knows i will shut it off for him. No more arguing about it. I like being able to turn off apps and keep him from seeing inappropriate things on the Internet.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great program,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My kid hated it,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great App for controlling how long your kiddos is on the device and what they might be looking at or doing. I would definitely recommend this to parents.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"OK, though expected more. Does not support Android TV (??), nor Windows. Week/Weekend days are not customizable. Not a comprehensive solution, an add-on that does not resolve the pain related to this subject.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"great app. my children are very unhappy with this but I manage to get them do great things to earn extra time like tide your room, more pages to read, throw the garbage or do something kind with your beloved.   I would like to see more concern regarding the access the porn sites. at 12 my eldest son is quite curious.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Easy to use and really effective for controling children usage with the phone,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's an amazing app! It helps to regulate the amount of time kids spend on their devices,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Fabulous tool to monitor my children's media! Love it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works well. Lock out times are great as are daily summaries of apps used. Definitely recommend it if you want to curb the amount of time your kids spend on technology.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's a good app however sometimes it randomly comes up with a message that says an app has been blocked when I don't even click on it. Please fix it.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is an awesome app that helps us keep up with what our kiddo is up to on his devices.  We think it's fantastic!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a parent concerned about my child's screentime, I am VERY happy with this app. My son gets to complete tasks (that I choose) in order to get more screentime, and when time's up, he's mad at the APP not at mom or dad. I love it!!! 5 stars. Buy the app, it's worth it, the moment you are spared one aggravating fight with your child, it's wayyyy worth it!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app. It simply works. Lots of features to really dial in the level of customization you need and once it's in place there is no more arguing over when to use it. I can leave kindle apps and learning apps unlocked and restrict video based apps to limit TV time.   Only suggestion is to allow multiple photos to be attached to a task request so I can really see their entire room when they claim it has been cleaned!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The does exactly what it is supposed to do. It helps limit kids screen time and allows parents to make enforceable decisions about what kids can and can't do.  The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because the app doesn't reach across platforms, so parents can't keep track of screen time for laptops, Xbox, platstation, etc... If becomes app was multi-platform, then it will be a necessary program for every parent.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app! Every parent should have it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works great, assigning tasks is encouraging kids to read more. First few days the kids didn't like it but now they don't mind and even go days without playing on devices.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has given me back a sense of control over what my kids are doing and watching online. Thank you. I don't want to watch over their every move but I do want to attempt to safeguard them and I feel that this app helps me do that.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best parental app out there! 5 stars,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app doesn't work and I could care less how many positive reviews it gets. It wiped out all the apps on my daughter's phone. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. You'll regret it and your child won't speak to you for a week. Waste of time.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love all the different features it has.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Tired of your kids vegging out on screen time? Tired of all the pressure from doctors, schools, other family members telling you that your kids shouldn't have their tablets available as much as they do? I get it. We used to have days when we just gave up and went ""here take it"". Sick of fighting over getting chores done? Finding it easier to just clean the kids room the to fight them to do it and end up working as foremen to the task? Well... Mom/Dad's about to have a new favorite app to rave about to friends, family, strangers. Im not the person that will spend money on an app. EVER, but this one is so worth it plus its uber cheep. So the kids ran out of time and want more. They can do ""tasks"" for more time. Well HEEELLLLLOOOOO weekend. My kids would use their time do a task for more time use that time do another task. And I had to keep adding more chore options because they would run out. Shocker here.... My kids actually are capable of doing so many more tasks then I thought they were able to once we ran out of normal chores I didn't know my kids could sweep mop and vacuum and the do these things happily because it earns them more tablet time. The kids are fighting upstairs while watching kids YouTube? No problem. Click ""pause"" and type note for kids ""5min time out for fighting"" amazing how well that's been working. Don't like paying money for an app your unsure of? Don't like setting up for a membership you will have to remember to cancel if you don't like it? No problem. They start you with a great free trial and no credit card needed. Do your self a favor. Just TRY IT. Your going to be sooo very happy you did.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have used this app for a couple of years and I LOVE it!  I  have found it to be very intuitive.    Before this app, I used a ticket system with my kids.  This is soooo much easier.  I can monitor my kids' screen time without a constant battle.  The app also gives me flexibility to add or subtract screen time as the situation arises.  I LOVE that I can set different time limits for different apps.  I can limit YouTube while giving full access to calendars, math games, etc.  I also love the different settings for bedtime and then for lights out.  I dont have to worry about falling asleep and then my son sneaking back onto his tablet.  I recommend this to all my friends, or, as my daughter would say, I ruin her friends' lives. 👍",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's the most useless app,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome app. Kids hate it. So it must be good,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is great I can see what my daughter is using and for how long she is using the apps I have a time limit on everything. She cannot get into the internet or Google and when she downloads a new game it automatically blocks it until I unblock it. Just wish it could show me who she is calling and texting. Other then that this app is great. If your child is not acting right you can shut their phone down where they can not do anything.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,it is stupid,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great! Makes it so easy to set limits. I especially like how I can let them have unlimited time with reading books or math practice apps and specifically restrict the game apps (or anything they tend to spend too much time on.) It's also good that I can handle everything from my computer rather than going into their device. I tend to be very frugal and resist paying for monthly subscriptions but this is totally worth it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is awesome my kids have to do chores before getting time on devices and I can pause anytime they are not listening or unlimited time for car rides!!!!!  Just put this on my sons phone(he has s 6)and locked the phone up so he can only call three people he can't dial numbers just the three numbers on the screen!!!!!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. Helps me help my children find more balance in their lives apart from electronics and has allowed me to taylor tasks to motivate healthy behaviors such as flossing their teeth and picking up their mess in order to earn more time. Awesome!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works well. I have been using it for about a month and is giving me a peace of mind what apps my child is using .,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I actually looked this app up before my kids got tablets.  I had learned from other parents first hand all of the pain that comes with arguing over when to turn off electronic devices.  In a word, amazing.  I love the app, and it does everything it promises to do.  It works well, and I absolutely love giving screen time in exchange for doing chores - yay!  Word to the wise - the first best time to get the app is the same time your kids get tablets.  The second best time is after they have had the tablets for awhile, but no matter what, get the app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I hate it,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"If I could rate an app higher than 5 I would. I can almost bet that anyone rating it below five either wants only free apps, or it is a kid or teen rating it. This is literally a parent lifesaver. Works awesome with the kid's tablets and cells. Paid for a year subscription and it was the best choice EVER",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app! It's so easy to both monitor and restrict how my kids use their devices.  The kids hate it, but even they have commented about how nice it is to do be able to send me a message saying they have done a task!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have three teen/tween boys who wanted the freedom of having their own devices but I didn't like the idea of just giving them free reign to go on whatever they want, whenever they want. This app was PERFECT! They don't even complain about it because they realize how much freedom it allows them. Even giving them the opportunity to prove themselves trustworthy and to earn more time.  I love that I can offer them extra tasks to earn more time and that I can choose exactly which apps they add, which they are allowed to access, and know at any given moment, exactly what they are on. I get to put a block on things like games during school hours, but they can still use their calendar, or calculator, or memos at that time! And I can make sure that they have their devices OFF when they should be sleeping! I love that I can also PAUSE their play time if I need them to come to dinner or do something for me! You know how kids can be when they are really into their games!   I wish it could tell me exactly what they are viewing on youtube or looking at on chrome! But I don't know of any apps that can do that just yet.  All in all, I highly recommend this app! Completely worth the price!",5

Also, it would be great if the app could use the map to track the phone location  ( to eliminate disruptive “Where are you?” texts).  I am thinking about  purchasing this app when the trial ended.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app! So easy to use and really makes it easy to keep track of my kids activity. Recommend the premium service. Being able to set time restrictions and block apps is awesome!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Excellent app, my kids know they have to do there're homework to get mins on there tablets",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,As a parent this is a fantastic app. My kids spend too much time on their tablets and this has let us have full control. It has also helped change their behaviour as they know by completing tasks they can earn their time. I can see why some kids leave bad feedback through frustration but as parents this app is fantastic for safeguarding kids and keeping control over their usage. Couldn't rate it higher.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Why do you all of the sudden on an update need access to my contacts????,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does its job,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this!  I used to have to take my daughter's phone away to limit her usage at night and overusage during the day ... which defeated the purpose of having a phone.  Now I can give her boundaries and still be able to reach her if I need to.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent app. Although I found it a bit fiddly to set up on my kids computer. Multiple accounts on his tablet caused confusion. I'm still not 100% sure what Screentime apps need installed on each device.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great in limiting my kids screen time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have tried them all including the Disney Hardware and Software solution and this is much better.  My kids found the TASKS feature before I did and now they clean their rooms and do different things throughout the day for EXTRA TIME!  I don't have to pay them to do things.  They would rather have SCREEN TIME!    All the controls to limit APPS and TIME work perfect.  Honestly, this is the only solution that allows me to lock things down so their device will only work as a PHONE when they need it and a toy when I allow it.  I travel a ton and able to manage it from remote.  Its been perfect!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,No single parental control app did exactly what I wanted but this one does what it says it will do and very well. I wish it could put time limits on specific apps per day. The controls and settings are straightforward and easy to use.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Beyond helpful! I can just pause the tablet until the chorus are complete. Setting a bedtime works wonders knowing their in bed by a certain time!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app works AWESOME! You can customize your own limits to suit you & families needs!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It does literally nothing and it can be uninstallable very easily.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Horrible on Asus tablet. We bought an Asus tablet for Christmas, installed screen time the same way as on other devices, but it simply doesn't work very well. It totally stops some apps from even opening, doesn't enforce bedtime reliably, doesn't track usage time correctly. I've contacted support, but as things attend the problems are still there. I'll update this review if the support team help solve these problems",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Found it really easy to use. On top of that, my teenagers are well under control now. At the touch of a button, I get things done around the house!!! They don't like it but I absolutely love it!!! One if the best apps out there that's worth the money!!!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Thanks to the Screentime Labs crew we managed to start getting control of the run away situation with the kids hiding their tablets and sneaking in nocturnal use and school grades started to plummet. We established the school time block, bedtime block and controlled usage. Two weeks of complaints later and we have acceptance and a manageable level of control, and rewards for chores.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's a great concept, but it did on several occasions lock my daughter out of all apps when she had earned free time.  I was unable to get them back in time for her to use her ipad, so she lost her reward, which was unfair.  Choosing to delete the app because of the glitch.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great on android. But then my daughter got an iPhone and it became a total nightmare. Had to uninstall it and look for another app.,3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app was ok a couple of years ago but it is still glitch and with only a 14 day trial and not FREE anything its a waste of time.

I had hoped this app would evolve but it's just more money for less.",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app to discreetly monitor and control kids phone access.  You can see if they are using it in school or when they are meant to be in bed.  Definitely recommend this,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Easy to use and Effective!    Screen Time gives my wife and I complete control over what my daughter is able to use on her phone and when she is able to use it.  Love the daily activity summaries that are emailed to us, the ability for our daughter to earn extra time by doing tasks and the ability to easily temporarily give her access to certain apps (or restrict apps) as needed.   Look forward to seeing future enhancements and to adding screen time to our daughter's tablet as well.  As our daughter gets older Screen Time's features will make it easy to modify access settings to give her access to what we feel she is ready for.  Thank you for developing this app that offers the control we've been looking for.  Keep up the great work!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app! Let's me have control on what my child is watching and playing. Love that my child can complete tasks for extra time. Really motivated her too do what is asked.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Love it!!! Its a must these days. Has a free trial then you have to pay for it. Lets you do many things.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app. Screentime works well. While not as fine grained in its controls, it is much easier and more intuitive to use than the other parental control apps I have used (MacOS and Funamo). The bottom line is that it is easy to set up to do what I need and has the right amount of useful, succinct  reports.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome app.  Probably the best parental control out there,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Ease of use is amazing. Can't beat the features for the price per month. I know my kids wouldn't rate it a 5 star, but I sure will. Highly recommend this app well worth the cost.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I wish I could set a custom screen time for different days of the week instead of just weekdays / weekends. We allow the kids to use their devices for a bit longer on Fridays than Mondays, so it is a bit frustrating to have those two days in the same group.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is an excellent app and I recommend it for every parent whose child is spending too much time on their phone/ tabs. I did research a few other options before zeroing in on Screen Time, but found this the most flexible one with maximum options for this specific need. It is very easy and intuitive to use after a couple of days. I have taken the paid option and am happy that the small amount is well spent given the way it has completely changed my child's mobile habits. My child is 13 and I believe this is the best time to control his habits before its too late. Earlier the better... Also, as my son informed me, he has put in a horrible review for this app with a 1 star rating. I am loving it :)",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app.... gives parent back the control.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love knowing what my kids are doing and setting time limits,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Terrible,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app! Complete control over what my kids can and can't do.  I have it set up so my kids earn screen time by doing their chores or ""task"" as they are called on here.  You can block certain apps at different parts of the day. Only thing I don't like is it showes your kids what task they have/haven't done for that day but not on the parental side.  You can search ""approved task"" but when you have multiple children it's kind of difficult vs. Just having a daily check list per kid.  I really love this app though.  So many great perks! I've already recommend it to all my friends and family!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works well. Wish it could tell me what Youtube videos were watched but still works as promised.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is fantastic!  I didn't realize how much time my daughter was on her tablet until now. It was ridiculous.  Some days she was on it for more than 2 hours!! Not cool. Love love love it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy way to ensure that my son stays within his allowed screen time and that he doesn't use apps or visit websites that are not age appropriate. Highly recommend.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Premium user. Does exactly what I need as an engaged parent.  Puts kids in charge of their own time and eliminates constant negotiation. Negative reviews are from resentful kids.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's useful. I like that I can see their daily usage by app. But doesn't allow you to create more than two time blockers. Free version doesn't allow you block the phone on demand. Still a good app,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Read the one and two star ratings to see what kids think of it, and the three, four and five star ratings to see what parents think of it. It works as described and provides a surprising amount of customisability (school time and bed time blocking as well as total time limits and apps that are excluded from the blocking (eg phone and messaging)).  I haven't found any parental controls comparable for android phones. It's a shame that we need something like this, but there it is, we do. Do yourself a favor and, more to the point do your kids a favor, screentime is a must have for parents and kids.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Worst app ever so limiting the reason I can barley use my phone please don't download it,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Brilliant app. A bit pricey though.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app!!! Helps limit my children's Internet use and helps me keep track of what they're viewing.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Wouldn't have minded a 1 off payment but at £29.99 per year its much to expensive for all I need it for.  A timer app to prevent my son from using his tablet during certain hours of the day is all I need.  Perhaps a tiered payment option depending on what features are required would be a idea?  If this was an option I'd purchase it no problem :-),3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app have been telling all my Friends and family about it, my daughter has become more helpful at home as the app allows you to set task for them to earn extra time on the phone, absolutely love this app paid the money for the yearly subscription no problem did not even have to think twice about it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love, Love, Love it! Of course kids hate it and write bad reviews, because IT WORKS!  I have disabled certain apps on my son's phone, and three is a bedtime restriction that disables everything. He tried to disable the app a couple of times the first week, and the app gave me an alert. I have now disabled his ability to use Settings on his phone, and told him he could either stop trying to uninstall it or give up the phone & tablet completely. I give him unlimited use to a couple of apps, he has to earn all other screen time, which is some through tasks one created within the app. Great app, I tell everyone about it!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Just what we were looking for. The ability to remotely control access to our daughters phone. Much better than just taking away the device leaving her without the ability to call or text in an emergency. Currently we use it on her Android and Kindle Fire.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works really well.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Too expensive,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Thank you so much for this app! My 11 year old has been wanting a phone, and I have always been resistant, telling her that someday maybe I'll give her something called a ""pager"" if she needs to get ahold of me. But it's a new age, and in trying to give her some freedom but also a way to contact us or authorities in an emergency, I realized that a phone was inevitable. However, that does not mean that I am comfortable with the things and or people she can access via the internet! And in comes Screentime. Yes it's a small chunk of money, and we are not wealthy people to say the least. But the ability to limit her internet time, help her manage tasks, and keep track of her web activity is priceless. The relief I feel giving my child this technology is greatly relieved by this tool. I am able to easily give her less or more access, or bribe her into doing chores for fun internet time, or consequently cut her off if she's being a punk. I love it. Get it. It works perfectly, no issues so far at all. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Screentime, for helping a neurotic technophobic parent and her tween navigate information, connection and freedom in the digital age.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Would be nice to limit individual apps.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy and effective,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I hate it because  i have it -.- its very affective and if your kids are addicted to their phones its good for them,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Control what you want for the amount of time you want,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Being able to see what my kids are doing is great. If they do there chores all I have to do is shut off the phone. Love it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Makes it easier to  help my kiddos get their stuff done.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Didn't work for me,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Perfect parental control! This app allows me to keep track of & control my sons device usage. It has allowed us to build trust- he can have all the freedom on his tablet so long as it's not being abused. Love it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Best app ever! Complete, intuitive, handy, powerful, flexible. Very happy with it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to use and has really stopped fight with the kids.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This helps regulate my 2 kids and helps me make sure their bed time starts properly, and they can sleep knowing there are no distractions. They get more sleep, and me a price of mind.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app takes away children's freedom. 💪👌👍Don't get it for your kids or they will hate you...haha, my kid wrote this.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I can really keep track of my sons screen time with this app.  I can make sure he isn't using his phone during school  hours or when he is supposed to be in bed. I can set the amount of time he is allowed to be on daily, and he can earn more time by doing his chores, or extra stuff around the house. At first he was irritated,  but not anymore. Read the reviews,  you will notice the biggest majority of poor ratings are from kids that are angry about it being installed on their phones or tablets.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. With 4 kids it has made it so much easier to control my kids usage and see excatly what they r doing on their ipads,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great tool that's easy to use for parents.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is awesome.   Time outside when my boys are not listening.  App control.   School and bedtime timer.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's easy to customize it to fit our needs and schedule. We love the convenience and simplicity. Our child loves the option of earning extra screen time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,You should keep the child's privacy:v,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Makes it easy to limit tablet time,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to install. Easy to control the kids tablet from your device.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"К сожалению, программа на устройстве ребенка сама не запускается - приходится делать это вручную, чтоб все начало работать. При всех плюсах, этот минус перечеркивает все.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My parents decided to download this and use it to stop me using my phone all the time. This annoyed me, so I deleted it and installed it on my own phone and now have full control of their devices. Bear in mind im 15 and don't need or want to be restricted to what I can do on my phone (which I paid for myself).",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The best I parental control/screen time system I have found. It seems to lack some of the features that other systems have, but it more than makes up for that in the stability of the system (which suggests more care went into its design). You only have to look at some of the angry reviews from kids going cold-turkey to see how effective this can be.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome about number of features. Poor design.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Perfect way to control what you're kids are doing on there device. The day limit and sleeptime function is very usefull! Good app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,By far the best tool out there. I know this is far reach but this app would even be more amazing if it could somehow get installed into Smart TV's. Also I know the primary focus is 4 devices but I would also love just a task list that doesn't reward with any time but still the same rules apply. Thanks guys,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Both my children are below 8 so setting expectations early has always been my priority. I've looked before for various solutions and the Android restricted profiles were useful but not able to limit much of anything except apps.  I can quickly and efficiently lock, unlock, add, and remove programs and screen time. The dev team is easily accessible through the in app messaging portal and will reply to any requests within 24 hours. There are still a couple of loopholes but nothing deal breaking. Must Have!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Obviously the children aren't going to rate this app too highly due to its very purpose, but it's so good for monitoring what your child goes on, blocking certain apps, setting bedtimes and the best - pausing the device for tea time for example.       I've had problems trying to get it to work on another child's iPhone though, hence only 4 stars.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Helping the relationship with my wife!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We've been using this app to set limits on our children's devices since Christmas and really like it. It's well thought out and allows a lot of granularity in the customization. We can shut down games, etc at night while allowing them to use reading apps a little while longer. Thanks for the well thought out app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is a complete stalker app parents can see w everything and control everything this app SUCKS,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It keeps me alert of what my daughter is using on her tablet.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app ruined my life but i can see how you adults like it,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great App.  much better than changing your WiFi password daily.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I am amazed at this app. I do not know why I did not find this app before. It works like a charm. I do not need to worry about negotiating with the kids anymore. The app takes care of it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works absolutely fine, I can monitor my daughters usage,  setting tasks for her to complete before she can access apps that I allow. It's also handy to be able to do this no matter where I am.....",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is  a really brilliant app! Although I am normally reluctant to pay for apps I considered it very good value for money when paying the premium version which gives us parents a really smart, very user friendly and flexible app. I've installed it on the smartphone of my 11 year old son. He has sort of accepted the app setting reasonable limits to his daily app-gaming and YouTubing, but in return he has no limits to apps like WhatsApp and Spotify. We are now getting along much better!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app to keep a handle on our kids tablet usage. Has also been easy to use and offers lots of flexibility,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My kids hate this app so I love it. I have complete control over when my kids can use their phones and what they can use. Even if they're blocked, they can still reach important contacts like myself and my spouse. I get a notice everytime they install a new app and I can choose to have it auto blocked until I approve it. I find the controls easier to set from my desktop, but it's easy from my phone. This totally gives me peace of mind and the kids have been a lot more productive.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is brilliant. We feel like we are able to safely let our children use their devices without worrying. The ability to select which apps count towards their daily limit is fabulous as we can always let them read e books or use the calculator without using up their limit. Bed time blocker and school time blocker are also very useful. This app is the reason our children were allowed to get their own tablets.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It is a wonderful app to make sure kids don't use their phone / tablet too much. Limiting their time / apps they can use avoids long discussions with them. They accept it quickly. Also great way to reward the kids for helping out, e.g. making the dishes. Love the app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Screentime works on both my kids phones.  This app is easy to use!  After being fed up with Verizon's family base app because it wouldn't work on updated phones, I tried the Screentime free trial...I immediately liked this better, my kids...not so much.  I like the cost, reports and ease of use.  I like that the kids can request more time for completing tasks.  Recommend!!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"my son was frustrated at first but he now understands why I use it, works great, the team is quick to answer your question 's. Kids need structure and you have peace of mind knowing what they are up to .",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has really helped my kids to manage their own time.  We thought we'd see a bit of frustration from them at first, but from the first day they understood what they needed to do to earn more time and when their apps blocked they simply put down their tablets and started on their tasks.  It was a miracle.  There wasn't even a tantrum when my 4 year old nephew was blocked while watching a video.  My 9 year old explained to him that time was up and he moved on without any tears or arguments.  Great app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I can control what my kids are seeing. Without this I came upon them looking up butts. After my trial I paid for one month and it immediately stopped it. They didn't like it, but I Love it! I can control how much time they are on and control each app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app, my kids are not fans of course. It has proven to me and my Wife just how addicted our kids are to the instant gratification social media provides.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We love this app.  There is no more fighting with the kids to get off their tablets.  They know when it is done and they get off.  I love being able to reward for doing chores.  It is so easy to modify at anytime.  Love it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this App. It has really  changed our lives!! It hlps me manage my kids and their time on devices.  Best App ever,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Really helps with controlling app time and get tasks done around the house first. Love it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is the best app ever......i can take away apps and still allow calls.   Bad behavior = no fun apps / good behavior = 1 hour app reward time.  And it keeps the data under control as mr 11 thinks it all comes out of thin air!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We are android users and we love this app. Great for controlling our three children's use of tablets and phones.  Was easy to set up and control from my phone. The 10 year old loves being set tasks so she can earn more time and is now much more conscious of her own usage. It's also great for seeing which apps they are actually using without having to peer over their shoulder. Might possibly be my app of the year!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I use screen time more to block apps on my daughters phone. She was using it inappropriately. I gave her the option of either installing this app so I can monitor how she uses her phone, or I get her a basic flip phone without Internet and the old way of texting. Now with screen time she can still have access to her apps but has to ask my permission to use them.  She doesn't mind having to ask knowing that it is either this way or a flip phone.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Better features include blocked apps and tasks,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We really like this app in our home. It is a great incentive device and really helps us as parents to stay up to date with our child,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It gives me the chance to monitor how my 12 year old uses his phone and prevent him for using it when he should be paying attention in school, doing chores, playing outside or hanging with his friends or pets. Love how I can control it from my own phone and block his phone or give him extra play time with a simple selection on my own phone!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works great for keeping kids on task and not just on their phones all day. I love that they can do ""tasks"" or jobs to earn more time. This helps strike a balance where they need to do things to earn more time if they want to.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I now can see what my kids are doing without them even know. And I can remotely SHUT IT OFF!!!!! This is exactly what I needed. Thank you so much for working hard to protect our babies. ❤,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Put this on my nine year old's tablet and it's been awesome. Pause is my new favorite toy! Need her to set the table? Pause the game play. Need her to do her homework? Pause the tablet. Daily limit is also great! When she runs out of play minutes, she can do chores to get more time. My kid is actually doing things around the house!

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have installed a couple of similar apps and I found Screentime was the only one with all the features I wanted.   I can control access to individual apps and services, allow installation or not of new apps, time management, access to the management via app or web and much more, all that at a totally reasonable cost. If you want the kid to have the phone at school only for calls or whatsapp, Screentime is great. I totally recommend this app.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I'm really impressed with this app.  It has great functionality and was very easy to setup.  I have a 9 year old who's tablet I use it on.  It allows us to give him freedom to use the Internet and other apps but monitor what he's doing.  I love the ability to control the app with my phone.  It's a great ability and saves me having to change the settings on his device.  I find it funny that the negative reviews are from kids.  Shows how well this app works :),5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Anyone giving this product anything other than a 5 either has unrealistic expectations or is a kid trying to sabatoge the reviews.  It is fantastic if you want to control the phone and want to know how it is being used.  You can monitor and control the kids phone from your phone.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It was what i was looking for! Before i had to hunt my kids down & demand their tablets! Now as soon as their  play time is over, everything gets blocked, &  they come to me with their tablets in hand!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Before screen time I have problem controlling my 3 kids' handphone usage. I am glad to have found this app to set boundaries. The tasks are motivation for kids to complete and get rewarded with extra time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is very good app for kids monitoring. It would be great if next version supports summarizing time from different devices.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is extremely useful. We live very busy lives and one of the biggest problems is finding time to watch over 3 boys. This app helps enormously. Happy to pay for the service and looking forward to more features.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Verizon family base sucks kids have s5 and cannot lock phone now because of software update on phone this works kids mad at me worth the money tells me apps installed how long on each app can lock any app give time limits and my favorite bedtime!!!kidscoming to understand my son was up until 1 am he is 12 now phone is off at 8:30 pm still can make phone calls at anytime if needed $19.99 for six months or Verizon doesn't work 5.99 a month and can't lock phone anymore,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,very good,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Highly recommended.  In today's world it's far too easy to just let your kids get lost in technology and forget about enjoying the simple things like playing outside, with Lego's, etc.  Since installing it and limiting the time, the kids have become more inventive and diverse in their play, been more pro-active in doing their homework, doing chores to earn more time and so on. The ability to allow certain apps like learning apps is also a great way to get the kids to get used to use their tablets for work related activities rather than just play.  Hope that future releases continue to add further features big and small.  One I am particularly interested in is the ability to track and block certain content on the web...  Love it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Do you support chromebooks,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app ! Have complete control over my daughters tablet as well as checking on her usage and what she's looking at ... definitely a MUST HAVE for children's safety ! And I've never seen her room cleaner 😁,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is so easy to use. I love that I can manage my kids' phones from mine. If my kids need access during a blocked time, I can easily give that access and then lock the phone up again. It has also opened my eyes to how much time my kids are actually on playing/time wasting apps.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"So pleased to find this app! My husband & I love it! Our daughter has not voiced out her opinions but her facial expressions say it all. I highly recommend this app especially for the Android users (nothing against Apple) for the simple fact that it's much easier for us to manage. The apps I completely disable on our daughters devices, mainly, are the Internet (Chrome, etc.), Google Play Store so she can't make a 1 STAR review on Screen Time app or download extra apps that we don't approve of or want to question her about and last but not least the Settings so that she doesn't delete Screen Time apps or keep changing the screen lock password every day. Hope this review helps you parents out there!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Ever since using Screentime, my child is more conscious of his playtime spent on mobile games, and YouTube.👍",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app and use it for all of my kids. It gives me peace of mind knowing they are safe on their tablets and the user interface is easy to use and has lot's of great options. It is nice having rules in place up front for my kids where they understand how long they can play without having to get on to them about putting it away for bed or you have been on it long enough.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Update...my son has found away to manipulate the app by having something hes aloud to have open in the backgroup and then open something hes on a time limit to have it not count towards his daily limit.  We felt that digital was changing out children and needed to find a way to control their phones.  We have had many friends download since we started using it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Only issue i have been noticing is the monthly fee. Why and i being charged 4.99 one day. Then a week later another charged has been posted in a different amount.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My kid hates it and I love it. He swears he's never on his phone, especially Instagram but now I have data for the conversation. It helps me get him into good habits for life not just my house. It's not a replacement for being a parent; it's a great tool for enforcing your expectations while they're not right next to you.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has been a blessing for me and my family.  No more arguments about phones, no more worries about what my teen is up to, and it gives me some leverage when it comes to chores and just dealing with teen attitude.  Oh is that attitude you're flipping me?  Oh look - your phone is paused until you straight up!  :)  Thank you Screen Time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,No. 1,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I can easily monitor and limit the phone usage of my kids.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My child, even after i blocked the settings, still is able to hack the app. I do not know how but please do something about it... he says that he clear the RAM of the phone then the app will be stopped already.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app for android. You can see everything they go on and limit time. You can also set bed times and pause their phone. However only downside is its not so great for iphone. I have 2 sons one on android one on iphone. The iphone kept crashing. Doesnt give accruate information. Says not online when he is. 4 stars... great for android,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great running and looking app, from what I've seen. But for an App that you pay a subscription fee(that has nice  payment options vers others) you should be able to track a lot more.  From one, tracking call and text messages.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Since installing screen time I can monitor my kids activities and make him earn the right to use his phone since I pay for it. He only gets 2 hrs all day and the rest he had to Earn. Screen time locks his phone at night so he can sleep and I can block his phone usage and specific apps during school time. His grades are so much better! I don't give a fart about him being upset about it, I'm not his friend I'm his parent and it's my job to make sure he is responsible. Thanks screen time! Best $5 I ever spent!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Yes, I'm 13. But we should be allowed to have opinions as well. Anyway, the app is great for parents, but it causes arguments and negativity between them and kids. My phone has little to no storage left and crashes all the time. You shouldn't have to use this because your too lazy to have taught your child responsibility at a young age(that sounds mean), you should use this from the beginning and show your child that being obedient gets you rewards.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So far it's been working perfectly; although the ability to have tasks add additional screen time is a mixed blessing.  Now they're asking what things they can do around the house to increase time when they run out - but they should just be dong those jobs anyway!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Keeps me in the ""know""of what my kids are doing!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has been great. It allows us to control the kids usage and make them want to earn more time. Won't say there were no hiccups but so far it's doing pretty much all I want it to. Can't give it 5 stars as there are some things I would like different and I have contacted their support already and the team there is quite responsive and the support is built right into the app. No separate emails or online forms to fill out just ask right in the app.,4

Maybe more granularity per device would be nice to have,  but all in all,  there is no better app for this than this one. Well worth the subscription.  Kids feel they can influence their time with the tasks and are very engaged about it. The timers put an end to the ""but I just started playing""  discussion for good",5

She is 8 yrs and now realises how much time she was on the device before we had this little gem put on. In fact she does not seem to use her tablet as much as before.  We can operate it in an instant, change times, block apps we don't want her to use, we can even block her attempts at uploading new apps, so she has our approval. It's a great piece of software.  There is a great option for her to ""earn"" extra minutes too... since having this it been a lot easier to monitor and control.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I downloaded this app when my son got his first cell phone. During the 2 week trial period I realized this app was exactly what I was looking for and gladly paid for it. Track time spent and block apps for multiple kids and multiple devices. See exactly how much time they spend on apps and control how much time kids spend on apps. This app is a must for parents so that kids don't have free reign on devices.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This stupid app had people harrasing me,1

Any chance that this is coming?,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The time counting (the most important function for that app) works bad. My kid had  55 min left, played 2 hours but the app says that 36 minutes left to play. Not ready to production, obviously.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Stupid,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love it! I'm able to monitor and pause my kids whenever it's also getting them to do their chores! Great app. I'm having a few issues on the Kindle fire but support is awesome and there for you when you need it. The price is also very nice I'm paid for the year with 4 devices!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My son who is 12 found a way to unistall the app on his tablet by going into the security settings and deactivated screen time and ultimately disabled and unistalled the app. Massive loop hole and definitely not worth 2.99 a month if a 12 year old can deactivate it.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Wow this app is amazing so pleased I found it would recommend it to all parents,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Perhaps it was an older OS issue. It kept locking my kid out even though he had available minutes.,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I'm a parent and it was so frustrating trying to control my kid's use of their phones - especially at night. Sneaking them into their room and using them for messaging until 11pm. This app is so great! I talked about the use and logic with my kids and we agreed on the limits, and they agreed. They can get extra time each day by doing tasks, and I've never seen them so keen to help around the house! Such a good feeling getting a message saying that they have completed some housework, and they send a pic showing what they've done.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app. Saves arguements with the kids about devices and limits. When they're allowed they know it and when they're not allowed they also know it, without me having to say a word. Love the pause function when i need to get them to do something. Very glad I found it!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,You do have to pay for premium features. But I'd say it's worth it. My kids really were unhappy when I locked them out of their phones and blocked certain apps.  We talked about the reasons and came up with solutions we all agreed on.  We're using the unpaid version for now and it only lets me view what their doing and view web history. Great app overall.  Tech use was getting out of control and we didn't always know what the kids were doing.  Now the kids are aware we're monitoring them and think twice.,5

I don't pay for many apps but happy to pay for this.,5

Does he enjoy having this app, I'm sure he doesn't but I trust him as far as he trusts himself so we negotiated a reasonable time and curfew and left open emergency needs only after that. It has gotten him reading again and away from spending all his time droning out on his phone. Its also in turn made me more aware of my use and actions on my phone. Its been good for us both.",5

And it's perfect for your toddler or your teen ager!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My daughter has ADHD and has a hard time following the daily screen limits we place on her. With this app we no longer have to fight about it. She can do additional tasks and ask for more time if she reaches her daily limit. Highly recommend this app!,5

They would sit on the couch with a tablet for ten hours straight if we let them and still be upset when we told them to put them down.  This gives us the ability to better control their game time without completely shutting them out from other functions.  It also allows us to offer rewards for chores and behavior.  I also enjoy the ability to see what their up to when on their tablets.  I love this app and would recommend it to other parents in a heartbeat.  My only complaint about the app is that we have found it works much better on android than apple.  We ran into issues with it shutting down or becoming corrupt on my son's iPod.  However, we have them both on android now and couldn't be happier.",5

Thank you , you've given us our children back and we talk more about why we want to control and have taken your advice about asking children their opinions etc so they also really involved . They keen to do the right thing and when their time is up they just hand over their screens and go and do something else like playing ! Or gosh go in the fresh air !!!!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best idea ever. Would not have brought my granddaughters their phones without an app like this as the oldest one has had a few bad experiences before now I can see exactly what she is accessing.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app which lets you control the screen time for kids. But I did not know that they charge monthly for this. I had to read the reviews to find out how much it costed. It would be better to put it in the description or somewhere so that people can decide if they want to go ahead and use it or not.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Beware, liars, dishonest: this app is advertised as free, but after a few days of use they will ask you to pay them money. If they had been honest upfront, there would be no issue. I would never give my CC info to a company comfortable with blantantly lying.",1

I love this app!!!  I have it on 3 of my 6 children's phones,  because the others are too old... I wish this app was out years ago!!!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Don't waste your money. If your kids figure our a loophole in the app they can get around all blockers and time limits and use whatever they want whenever they want without you knowing. When they use this loophole the apps they are using, the websites they are on, and the searches they conduct do not register with the app so you have know idea what they are doing. It does not show up on the parent app so when you do a spot check to see what they are doing it will not show up and you think all is well.",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I LOVE this app. It is truly amazing! At first my kids were doubtful, but now they actually like it. They're doing nicer things for one another, helping me out more. Yes maybe to earn more screen time, but they are learning to manage their time on their devices and that it is a privelage.

It also allows me to put in time to shut his phone down for example school time all I did was allowed text messages and phone. Then when he is off school he has full access.  It also alerts me when he downloads a new app on his phone. I have a year subscription it didn't cost much for the ease of mind knowing what my child does on the phone. Highly recommend.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It work good for about 2 days. When you block out her phone all the apps disappear which is fine but when i added time for her to be able to use her phone and none of her apps came back.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Dont waste your money.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This program does exactly what it says. The remote parental controls are great. The ability to temporarily enable or disable all kid devices is a killer app. My only real disappointment is that all devices associated with a child do not share a pool of screen time, so my kids get double the time on days when they transition between my house and their mom's house, even though all the kids devices are registered in the same household. Be sure to disable the ""battery optimization"" by feature in Android.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Incredibly helpful app, especially when controlling from an Android device. I can limit my son's daily use, block at the app level and reward him with additional time when I'd like to (or take it away).  My only problem with it is that it is not able to limit the very popular House Party app. It blocks full usage of that addictive app, but lets windows still pop up that lets our son continue to use it in limited fashion as long as he'd like. I'd love a fix for that - other than that, this app is a lifesaver.",4

I thought my daughter would struggle with the new time limits we enforced, but she adapted pretty quickly and doesn't even argue when her time's up.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Have been trying a few apps to control the kids devices and this is the best one yet.  Relatively easy to install altho had some issues with a xiaomi. The app monitoring is accurate and updates real time.  Boy needed an app approved I was able To do it instantly via the app.  It did take a while to get up and running though in that after the first install it wasn't able to track the apps but once it's all working am. Happy with it.  It's not so intrusive or pervasive on the kids phone and the five-minute warning is great as I had some. Complaints when previous app shut down phone without warning,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app does what it is intended to do. My only problem is that it can really force people to hate their parents.

That is by far the best way to use this apps power over devices. I am speaking from experience.",5

Screen Time made that possible! In general, this is a really great start. We've only been using it for a few days now and there are a lot of things I like about it but also a few things that need improvement. The company behind it seems responsive enough to support tickets, so buy premium and support them so they can keep working to improve it!",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have found this app very useful to control the tablet usage of my daughter. There could be improvements to it though.

I generally don't like paying for apps, but this one is feature rich enough to warrant the premium service.

Listen, there's a lot of nasty stuff out there on the internet, and you can use this app to not only to keep tabs on whether your kids are getting into that nasty stuff, but you can also block the kids from getting ahold of it in the first place.  If you have struggled with the question ""My kids love their tablets, but I just can't keep an eye on their usage"" then look no further.  The premium service is a measly $40/yr.  That's 8 lattes for a year's worth of peace-of-mind that you know what your kids are getting into even if you can't watch them every waking moment they're in front of their screens.  Also, read all the 1-star reviews for hearty chuckles where kids pose as parents to rate the app horribly.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has been very effective in monitoring the use on my child's tablet. I highly recommend it for any parent wanting to have more control over how much time is spent with digital devices and what apps they are allowed to use. The only feature i would like to see is the ability to set time limits differently to seperate apps. So if I want to open up the kindle app for extra time reading it wouldn't allow all the other permitted apps to be used.

Its been very helpful. Most teens dont want this but its best for them really. Any parent who loves the child will want them to grow up the right way. Initially its an issue but when the child knows its for his good, he understands and complies.This is a good app. Works very well so far on our android phones.

Plus it's given us a lot of chances to talk with our girls about the roles their phones play in their lives.  If you're going to use this app, we encourage you to do as the developers say - don't just use it as a rule enforcer, but rather as a tool to help your kids learn self control for themselves.  Talk with them about the reason you're doing this.  Allow your kids to help you set limits and rules.  Emphasize it as a tool for them to stay safe and to learn important skills, rather than simply a way to punish them.  Consider having a list of things they can do once their time runs out - books to read, play an actual game with you or with a sibling or friend, spend some face-to-face time with someone.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,VERY nice Tool .. Well done ... Yes ... My son hates me ... lucky me ... the application works !!!. I am his father/ parent not his best friend.   I love my son and therefore I installed this App.  I don't want discussions with a 14 year old son about how lang and what to use on his phone. Installed app within 3 seconds and setttings are from 07:00am until 07:00 PM  for 3 hours a day. After that timeframe only a tool to check his homework is working. Very nice.  My son can earn more time if he do some tasks but he is not willing to do that. I don't care . This tool wil lock his phone as expected.  I have some simular tool installed on his PC  -> TimesUpKids.

I can allow basic phone functions and the ability to listen to podcasts at night, more functionality during the day, and a time limit on games and apps that let them watch videos. The reports also inform me of what they are spending time on which helps me detect any back doors they have found. For example, I put LastPass on my son's phone without restrictions and he found he could watch endless videos through the built-in web browser. I figured it out on the first day because the report showed he spent three hours using LastPass, which was a bit much for a password manager!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My daughter was really cross when I installed this app but now she just accepts when her time is up and finds something else to do - thank you,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I've recommended it to everyone from friends to my children's therapists! I can manage the devices and we are seeing more family time. Thank you!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"At first i was very happy and went on to pay for the premium version, only to find that it wasn't syncing correctly I'd turn apps on or off and they would appear to change then I'd go back to find that they had stayed the same!! Also my son found a way around the controls and basically had full use of the phone, then to top it off he managed to download an app which let him completely delete screen time from his phone, im very disappointed as it was absolutely fantastic at first!!",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Don't have to nag at my child anymore as his screen time on the mobile is now under control automatically. Moreover, we are notified of any new app installation and unusual activities. And there's motivation to complete tasks to get approval for additional screen time. Would give a 5 star if the lag for play time is reduced.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"If you have young children with phones this app is a must have. Easy to use and navigate, it helps you see what you kids are doing and easily stop them from doing things you don't want them too.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app! My daughter doesn't give me issues, she has A's and B's does her chores (does more than her chores without being told) BUT loves to be on the phone late on school nights.  I set her bed times and it gives us time to visit before she goes to bed. It also helps me keep the toddler limited to tablet time. Love it! (Singing) (kinda slows my phone though) It does the job so I rate 5 stars!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is a ""CHORE"" saver!!! It has gotten my 15 year old up and more motivated to help more around the house!!!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We tried it on another tablet for our daughter and it worked great! We got a year subscription and a tablet that would be better suited for her. In the end the app was too powerful for the tablet to run it correctly. The team was excellent in their communications and we tried to get it working. They offered a full refund. We ended on  good note, looking forward to seeing what is to come. Great idea and good service. Thank you.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It tends to freeze up and won't allow me to play or pause his phone. That is the reason I pay $4 a month in order to get control over his phone. Without being able to do that it causes frustration.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's a great app and definitely helps me moderate what my kids should use or see in their devices. However, I think a widget would be really great so you could see in real-time what app is being used and for how long.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great App!  I've tried a lot of these types of apps but they all have shortcomings.  Screen Time is the first one that is reliable, does what it says it does, and is 100% effective.  It's also easy to install and use.  Thank you ScreenTime - you're saving my kid's brain!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is listed as free and states you ""can"" get a premium trial for 14 days. After providing all your information so they can send adds to your email and then spending time to set it up you find out you are automatically in a 14 day premium trial. APPS that advertise this way should be pulled and not allowed to be marketed as ""FREE"".",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Just gets neutered behind the premium wall. But I get it... People like to be paid for their work. And I'd definitely pay... But not for a subscription.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Very glad I bought this app. I have 3 children & monitoring how long they spend on the internet has been a real stress..they were always going over the limit! What I find very useful is that they can choose when they like to go online, it doesn't have to be a set time, so they can have their daily hour in smaller chunks if they like. I also like that I can choose which apps are part of their daily limit...others eg camera &show my homework, they can use anytime. Works on the Kindle too, unlike the free apps",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It limits the amount of time my daughter can use her phone but it allows you to reward behaviour like finishing homework by giving extra time.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"By far the best parental control (PC) app out there! After 2 wks using this app I canceled my carrier's PC app. This is MUCH better. User-friendly, great price, peace of mind knowing which apps my children are using & a great incentive for timely completion of chores. I love that I can grant add'l time for tasks (of my choosing) completed. My children didn't like it at first, but now they realize how much time they were on their devices and happily do extra around the house for add'l time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It does work as intended to.  We don't have to fight over how long he stays online cause this App. gives you full control of the kid's device plus the my son can review how much time he is spending on screen vs how much time is left thus an opportunity to learn how to budget for ""limited resources "".",5

I gave the app three shots, there will be none more.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have two young kids who need limitations on their devices. This app is exactly what I was looking for to allow them to play with my supervision but without having to constantly look over their shoulders. I can pause their play if I need their attention right away, limit how many hours a day they use which apps, and make sure they don't play too late on school nights with the bedtime lock feature. I have tried other apps in the past and this blows them all out of the water and is definitely worth the $$.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I was really anxious the way my kid was getting addicted to gadgets day by day. And this app really helped me a lot, it was like a rescuer.   My kid is more disciplined now and concentrating more time on studies and even when she uses her gadgets it is more productive.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have tried all the parental apps and have found the only one that works well is Screen Time. I liked it so much that I've subscribed to the paid service. I love that the price applies 'per family' instead of per child / per device.  My 3 kids hate it - just means that it works fabulously. Some of the hilarious 1-star raters are kids like mine who can't stand it :),5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"In todays day and age kids nowdays take their ""real time"" with their friends and family for granted! All you need to do is go into YouTube all look up all of the parents loosing their minds over their kids excessive use of games apps and phones etc! And parents UNTIL NOW have been helpless to stop it! YES this app gets poor ratings from kids because at 9 years old they cant look up XXX rated content! They're not ""free"" to browse and learn and see things their minds simply are too young to handle! Life saver",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Excellent app, allows me to control how much time my daughter spends on her devices, while also limiting which apps she can actually run. Gives me visibility into my kids devices without me having to ask for the device so that I can check it. Avoids arguments like ""Get off your tablet, I asked you already, you know you should be off it"". Instead of asking her to self limit, this allows me to say ""you only get 30 minutes of youtube"" and it does the limiting for me!  Don't believe bogus 1 star reviews by annoyed kids who don't like that their parents actually care about them! I wish they offered a Windows version of this app so I could control my daughters laptop as well!!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Thank you for helping keeping my kids safe,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great for 1 kid.. Testing with a 2nd soon,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does exactly what I need it to. My daughter hates it but that just means it's working! Love that I can block apps like youtube as restricted mode on Google doesn't block all explicit content. Being able to block it via Screen Time is great. Also love that I can set time limits. Well worth the 2.99 a month.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,No more arguing with my kids!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is brilliant if you want to take back control of how long your kids spend online. Since installing we have got our kids attention back. Highly recommend this to anyone with kids who have distanced themselves from reality.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Superine programa,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We are an Android household and we are loving this app! My kids are 6 & 9 and I'm finding that they actually like the predictability of knowing how much screen time they are allowed. The extra tasks for extra time is proving to be pretty cool as well,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Its really good to control your child time on mobile...and to monitor his activities,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's very good at shutting down the phone just before bedtime.  It eliminates the struggle to get my son to go to bed since he can no longer use his phone.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I work in IT and I have not found a better app to limit screen time on a tablet or phone.  It literally converts your little zombies back into humans you can interact with.  A great app with scale-able controls that doesn't just lock things down but encourages better behavior by using a chore list that if completed can be rewarded with extra screen time, Excellent positive re-enforcement .  We use it with our 3 ADHD & ASD kids after the initial resistance from them,  we now don't have any confrontations about coming off their devices to eat etc.  I thoroughly recommend it for kids with special needs or neurotypical, all I would suggest to parent trying it is don't give up when your kids initially kick off because you've installed it, after a while of standing your ground you will reap the rewards.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is amazing I love being able to see what my kid is doing when he thinks no one is watching,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The best parental control app on the market... It is worth the nominal monthly fee that is charged. I had a real issue with getting my 7 year old son to put his tablet down, especially when it was time to go to bed and before getting on the bus for school! With this app installed on devices your children use, It does everything you want it to do. As a computer technician myself, I am always getting asked about the best content blocker for phones & tablets. I am already teaching them how to set this up for their devices. Please don't believe any  of the negative reviews posted by mostly kids frustrated that this software works so well, just try out the trial and you won't be disappointed!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app, to me, is worth every penny.   I can monitor my kids screentime, see what they are playing and also shut their device down or add time from my phone.  It has taught them how to manage their screentime as well and what is worth playing.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Don't get it,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Extremely easy to use and set clear limits for your kids.  Appreciate that it offers the ability for your kids to do tasks (chores or acts of kindness) to earn time.  I feel like setting appropriate limits while still allowing your children room to explore paves the way for appropriate use of internet/ social media in the future.  Blanket restriction always backfires.  My oldest is very aware of why we set limits and that they aren't a punishment but a way to keep her safe. Very happy with this app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Since I installed it   I am agein in control,  bed time is on time,  and everybody is on time for diner,  I just pause all kids devices. Recommend for all parents.",5

I was tired of fighting with my kids to shut off their tablets so I was actually going to buy new Samsung Galaxies that have the new parental controls and child interfaces because the Tab 2 and Tab 3 don't have this feature. I decided to give this app a try before I made these expensive purchases. This app was extremely easy to set up and is super user friendly. My kids don't mind it, they just let me know when their tablets shut off because when that happens, it's time for bed (or they have used up their time and have to ask for more time or I can make them do a chore or 2 and then give them more time. Well thought out app! Love it! So glad I downloaded it!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I've tried several parental control apps and found this had everything I needed.  This app gives me the ability to control multiple devices for one child in one place and from my phone (not a Web site or the actual device).    Changes made to the setup take affect immediately on my child's device(s).  The play/pause feature makes it easy to extend or interrupt usage of the device.,5

My daughter doesn't like the app but has gotten used to the fact that it's here to stay. She completes tasks without prompting from us because she wants the extra time awarded to her. I highly recommend this app! Compared to other apps, Verizon FamilyBase ex: I didn't like it because it didn't have the control that Screen Time does, however, I did like Verizon's ability to put a data usage block after a certain amount on the phone.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to use and easy to controll the mobiles of children,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I found this as a great application to control the applications my kids play on their devices. I found it after Verizon didn't make it's family base app Android 6.0+ compatible. I use this and Verizon's family plan manager to limit how much my kids are vegetating in front of their devices. I liked that I was able to test drive the application in full before I chose to subscribe. I like that the cost is a lot more reasonable than other applications of a similar kind. I recommend this app to any parent.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The expression on the kids faces when their app or tab gets locked down is priceless. Love this app!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The App delivers what it promises. Situation totally in control after this app. Discipline and order reinstated.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,App helps me keep track of what my kids are doing on their devices AND helps me control the amount of time they are glued to their phones.

When we do this the functions stop working.  I then have to reopen app to get functions working but my kids are 5&6 and know how to close current apps so it's not what I expected.

We've tried restarting phones & that doesn't work so we end up just going in & resetting their limits. If this is an easy fix, please do so. I'm sure this effects more than just us. Thank you...& thank you, even more, for creating such a wonderful app!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I like the app all but one thing......If my child goes on Netflix or watches something online, I can see that she's went on Netflix or Youtube but I cannot see what she's watching.  If she goes onto YouTube, I also cannot see what she's typing or commenting and only that she went onto it.  It is in fact the job of the parent to monitor these things.  We shouldn't allow an app alone to monitor our children and we need to be responsible ourselves in doing this and making sure the content out children watch is appropriate.  However, the app is just a little extra help. It makes life easier so that I do not need to ""hover"" over my child constantly.  If it continues to work well, I will consider the purchase of the app to be worthwhile.  Thank you to the creators of the app.  Once your child becomes too old for the  ""KidsPlace"" (as mine has)app(also highly recommended), I'll likely stick to this one. Thanks again.  Good job!",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My son received his first smartphone 3 months ago. I was worried at the age of 11 years old it was too soon for such a big responsibility, and sure enough the phone consumed his time, his awareness, his whole day. Just when I was about to correct the problem permanently I stumbled upon this app and it CHANGED THE GAME for me and my child. The very first day he wanted to complete every task, my house has never stayed this clean with 5 kids! Screentime is a must have for anybody with a preteen using tech!",5

However, my 12-year-old daughter cracked this app. Even though we set some apps as blocked ones, but these apps could be unblocked after my daughter opened and closed a app then clicked split screen button, then touch the app's header for a few seconds. Please fix these bugs, and please add a function that parents control all app's time independantly. This is very essential. We realized it just today after she has done this for a month.",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My son initially had issues with this app, but actually asked to go back to it when I switched.  He fought it at the start, but once he understood it was a timer or no phone, he bought in and we never had another issue. A couple of weeks ago I had an issue with the desktop timer app I was using -- when Microsoft reset the computer for updates the app wouldn't run properly. So I tried Kazpersky Safe  Kids as an alternative for both the desktop and phone. After a couple of days experiencing Kazpersky's limited schedule options and hard cutoff with no warning, he asked to go back to Screen Time for his phone.  I like the Screen Time's multiple timer options (school day/weeked & school time/bedtime windows with down to the minute settings and app-by-app exceptions), and the detailed reporting. It's way more flexible than Kazpersky.  However, as an old school techie I always want even more control. For example, my son would like permission to play at lunch on school day's and I'd like to let him.",4

I love being able to remove myself from the equation with my son who has autism and argues a lot. I just pause his device from my phone and send a message with it to go do his task now. No arguments!! When we first started he thought it was his ""smart"" tablet telling him he was smelly and to take a bath lololol we had some fun with that for a while!

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It works really well.. have tried various others and all are easily bypassed by tech savvy kids. There are some great features like adding time for tasks.. sending messages and pausing play (eg ""10 mins to dinner""). Paying for 12 months up front makes it pretty good value too. Interesting how many kids are giving it hate here.. obviously that shows it must be effective, but I think it shows a lack of mutual understanding between child and parent. A contract can help here.. and actually there's one on the screentime site.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great little program. Easy to use. Works a treat,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My dad made me install it and didn't let me delete it. But there are multiple ways past it. If you go usage manager then you can clear all your apps and it shuts it down. You can go into settings and make a new account. And if settings is blocked all you have to do is shut down your phone then when you turn it back on it takes about 30 seconds to load back into the background apps and it's enough time to make a new account,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"A good way to control kids screen usage, avoiding endless negociations. I'd like to be able to add a desktop to devices list and to set an overall time limit for all devices ( e.g. not each device to get 1h or so ).",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Just give it a try!.  Less hassle for parents!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This application is just perfect for controlling kids' screentime and to limit hours spent generally on gaming - but without limiting call/instant messaging time. In our case at least, kids were accepting the daily limits pretty well, and quickly learned to check out how much screentime is left. The limitation is also very useful when kids are at grandparents and would play too much, and also to restrict Pokemon go playing at schooltime:) Definitely five star app (from parent point of view;)",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Yes this is a great app. But I am thinking it costs a bit more than it should.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Ignore the one star reviews from frustrated kids; if anything they're proof that this app works brilliantly!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love that this app has an easy to use interface.  It's easy for the kids to earn extra minutes and to set separate weekday and weekend bedtimes. My 11 year old said that she actually likes the time limit because it reminds her that she can be doing other things like reading or playing outside.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Totally worth the money!!!! My kids now can earn screen time by actually DOING their chores! And I can approve their time whether I'm home or not. They can send images proving they've done their chores. My house is happier and cleaner! My only request is for a computer version of the app!!! I want MORE sevices covered!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love it. We installed it first thing before even letting our kid touch her phone, and had a discussion about how we would use it. She's not happy when her time runs out, but that's the rules. She can do chores to get more time if she wants. I recommended it to another parent, and she loves it as well. Her kids are a little upset at me.😂",5

When they reach their daily limit, they can request more time by completing chores or homework. This app is a must for any kids cell phone.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good app but the subscription is expensive a little bit,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's a good concept and a necessary application. However, if a child has multiple devices, the per day limit is applied to every device, multiplying the limit. Not really what.one wants. I want one limit for the cumulated time passed. Also, the applications being blocked for one or the other reason (daily limit or bedtime) seem to get mixed up. Once I found settings in the list, but which can't be activated or not. I'll get one month of premium, but not sure to continue afterwards....",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I am an IT pro and liked this application. Highly recommended for the 21st century parents.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a kid I don't like it, but as a parent it is a great app! 👍👍👍",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app takes the argument out of the equation and puts control back in the parents hands. Love it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My daughter has used her phone every day since we downloaded this app.  It worked the 1st day reporting the  actual time she used it and then the app has claimed she hasnt been online since.   This is useless.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it. It's simple and effective!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app makes the boundaries we set very clear, and our kids can't argue about how much time they spent on their ""shinies"". :-) Also, when I needed technical assistance, customer support emailed me the information I needed within 10 minutes.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Unlike what you might think, this app actually relieves tension between me and my son. There is no more debating how long he's been playing, ""just one more level!"" and the like. Also, I LOVE not having to watch the clock to make sure he's abiding by the time limit I've set. If you are a parent of a kid with an electronic device (in other words, all parents) you will love this app! And after the initial upset, my son also says he likes this app because he can earn more time by completing tasks I create.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The app works wonderfully! The updated version makes it easier to use. Customer service is quick to respond and very helpful.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It is effective in limiting my children's access to apps, limiting screentime and my teen girls enjoy being able to win some extra screen time when they complete chores. It notifies when your child downloads apps, and if someone enters your parent password. I've been trying many parental controls, interested in finding the best for our family. I decided to subscribe, it is worth paying for. I would like it to have a log of text, messenger and wassup  messages, and all facebook activity. Thanks!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have two children, one with apple and the other with android devices.  Works well sometimes but is temperamental, particularly on apple devises, on which it regularly stops working, completely removing all apps to the extreme frustration of user.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Its an ok app but my 13 yr old has figured a couple ways around the app,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It could be perfect but for one detail. My kids found a way around the time restriction by creating a secondary account on their devices. It should have a warning if such action was taken. Android M. I'm still on the trial version so I think I'm still going to be looking.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I am a paid subscriber and a parent of 4.  My kids hate this app which means it works amazingly!  No more collecting 9 android devices at bedtime or kids sneaking their phone until 3am on school nights.  This app allows me to monitor, review, and change parental controls down to the app level in real time! Even better than that, I can make changes remotely.  I highly recommend this app to all parents that have children of any age. Expecially parents with teens.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app works perfectly for our family. I'd researched several others, none of which had the flexibility we needed, and was delighted that this worked so well. I also  really appreciated the free trial upfront before I paid the fee. It has great flexibility regarding which apps are time limited and, while he doesn't always admit it, our son is happier and more talkative as well. Perfect.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best app ever!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So simple to use and great for keeping tabs on the kids tablet usage. Has actually meant they've normalised the hours usage they get each day so it's no drama when time is up!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,5 stars all the way - great app and would recommend it to any parent or accountability partner who wants the best for those in their care.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Helps manage what is seen on the phone and control the amount of time spent on said phone! Ensures they concentrate on things that they should be concentrating on!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app.  Homework, tidy room, pack bag and clothes, and other daily tasks are now completed without question.  I don't have to argue when I want daughter to take   a pause.  I give extra time if needed, but there is a limit daily. I also block things that I do not want used.  It's great!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent App. Has really improved our home life. The kids were using their tablets constantly. After a while using this app the kids don't even use all their allotted time and want to help with the cooking and around the house. Would definitely highly recommend this app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app. It really helps me monitor my son's usage on his tablet. My favorite part is creating tasks that he can complete to earn more screen time (cleaning, reading, play outside). He has also become more aware of how much he does use it and watches his time! There is much less fighting about how long he had spent on the device, we can look together!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Your kids probably won't like it,  but you will.   It allows me to limit my 5yo's use time as well as keeping him out of the app store.   It's by far the best way to limit the age appropriate content.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My kids may not love this app but my husband and I do. I love the feature that let's you pick the time restricted apps and still allows us to leave other apps (like their readers, school apps, and other educational apps) unlimited.  Love the tasks feature too...our 6 year old loves to do things on the tasks list because she can send us a picture of her work.  She does them even when she isn't out of minutes! Thank you for making this app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This application has been an absolute godsend in our house! We no longer have arguments when its time for bed or to do chores etc. My daughter has ADHD and it was always a struggle to get her off of her tablet without her having a complete meltdown and her anger being directed at me. Now she understands that once her screen time is up and she gets the blue screen on her tablet, its time for bed or whatever else and she happily packs her tablet away. I love that extra screen time can be allocated as a reward",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Children are held accountable to do the tasks that are required and they earn extra playtime or lose Play Time depending on their performance,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Hahahah, seriously though this app is a must have for any parents concerned with their children's hours spent with their nose in technology. Limit their time and access to apps, create tasks they can perform to earn additional time and set bed time and school time limits so that you can feel confident they're not abusing their devices. I've never given a review before on any other app, so that should tell you something!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We tried all of the premium features for the free period and love the visibility provided on what the kids are doing online. We paid for a six month subscription to the premium service. I like that I can pause or add time for screens at any time with a couple quick clicks.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"If you want to have the ability to see which apps your kids are using & how long they spend on them, this is the app you need.  I love that I can do the bedtime & school blocker and especially if they aren't doing chores or homework, with a touch of a button, I can shut it down.  The kids think it's irritating but it's obvious why.  They no longer can be sneaky by downloading new apps after you restrict one.  I started  with the free trial but after a couple days it was a no brainer.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a parent of a child who has trouble managing her time, I find this application very useful.  I am not curious to read the contents of her text messaging with her friend, but just wanted her not to be playing games or instagramming when she should be doing her homework.  She used to spend one hour of the pottie, now she cannot do that.  I have bedtime blocks and application blocks, and also blocked download, so she cannot download apps, without my permission.  Thank you to the coders to screentimelabs.!!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My daughter earns her time and the apps she can use when on her device are set by us so there are fewer arguments and more conversations.  We really need this on Apple devices as well.  It is so easy to use and the fact that her father and I both can adjust access, settings and tasks from our devices is very convenient.  Well done!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We had this app a few years ago and then let the kids remove it but we are back because it's the most effective way to limit their device usage that we've found. The annual fee for the premium account is worth the features.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Brilliant! My daughter really hates this app. But at least I'm able to control the amount of time she spends each day. My husband and I are able to track which apps she uses as well as the websitrs visited. A great help to all parents!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has cut out all of the conflict I used to have with my 8 year old.  He knows what time he has allotted and that is it unless he does something to add more time. Love it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have a 16 year old who would spend all day on his phone if he could, including school time. He is a computer wiz and has hacked his way out of 7 other parental control apps on his phone, except for this one.  In the past month, since we installed screentime, he has gone to bed on time, is more respectful and is getting great grades.  Highly recommended!  The only bad reviews are from kids whose parents got smart and installed this app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love being able to limit and monitor the where she goes, what she downloads and even how much time she spends on her phone.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to use and ends the fight. The tasks to allow the kids to earn more time is great. Highly recommend.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is the best app ever. As a parent now I know what my kid is doing and can limit the time so family time can happen again. I usually don't sell ads and stuff but it's good to buy. Yes the kids aren't happy but it keeps them safe and it's cheep. I've had it for 2.5 months now. And love it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. It helps me monitor my son's time on his tablet and phone. I was having a hard time keeping g him off of YouTube. I am able to block it with this. Also I can set chores for him to do to earn more free time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,There are few bugs here and there but nothing huge. Sometimes the daily limit does not come into effect until our son tries to switch into another app. I've seen this at least twice when he is playing Growtopia.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great way to avoid arguments with the children about their devices  Great support if needed,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app works remarkably well. As much as i don't like restrictions like this i think it important for kids. The level of control is very grannular allowing to restrict certain games whilst keeping educational apps available. I would recommend to all parents with young kids.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My children were spending all their time on their phones and devices and I needed an app that would help me take back control, and get them back in the real world. I found this app and thought I would do the free trial, which worked a treat. Then the trial ran out and they were back in zombie land, not doing as they were asked or doing the jobs that they were supposed to,  which is why I then got the full version. IT IS THE BEST APP I HAVE EVER GOT. My 12 year old absolutely hates this app, and it is the worst day of his life when I got this app.   I would recommend this app to any parent who wants their children to be part of the real world and not phone, tablet zombies.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Ok, so after using this for a few months I love it! It doesn't surprise me that kids are giving it negative ratings, but I also blame that on the parents for not educating their kids on the purpose of the app. Also, you can block your kids from accessing the app store as well. I am a father of 3 and this app gives me exactly what I need for monitoring what is going on my kids' phones. School and Bedtime blockers are perfect. The daily email summaries are perfect. Don't forget to actually speak to you kids!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Disclaimer:  I am a parent, hence the 5-star rating and not a kid (who usually leave 1-star ratings ;)  )  This app is great.  Easy to configure, being able to black/whitelist apps from taking time (so, I can set no games or netflix, but if my kid wants to skype with a friend, she can), It's easy to add/remove time whenever I want, and I really appreciate the alerts for the apps that she is installing.  Honestly, my only issue with this app is that I cannot install it on my tv's. :)",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Effective!  Controls time on device.  Allows me to set tasks like homework and chores for reward time.  Kid is unable to uninstall on their device.  Makes it possible to completely avoid the situation of physically taking the device from the child, which causes physical resistance and angry tantrums.  It just magically stops working.  No battle!  My daughter really does see the value in it.  However, she has started using other nonsecured devices (e.g. mine) when she runs out of time.😃",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best parental control app!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I've been using this app for a few months now. My kids hated the app at first. After a few updates and contact with the staff. Most of the issues are resolved now. My kids have learned how to budget their time wisely. I give them 1 hour during week days and 4 hours on the weekend. If they need additional time they ask and we talk about it.  It teaches them time management. The staff are great if you have any issues or questions.,5

Installed this program and it really lets you customize what and when they can use it.   There have been times when I've shut it down to absolutely nothing but text because that's how we communicate mostly. The day after I installed the app, she was texting me like crazy asking for things to be turned back on.  After a few days she settled into the time frames allowed and all has been awesome since.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"For a few of $3.99/month for premium, you would think it could include gaming systems on network.  Heck, my 11 year old son would simply put his headphones on and switchover to gaming on the Xbox when this app disabled his tablet access.    The reviews are great, but not what I am looking for in a monthly fee (subscription) app.  Not to mention it looks easy for kids to disable or uninstall the app from working on their end.",3

I'm not one for spending on apps but I think this is the best value app ever. Just buy it you will not be disappointed. I have also found the technical back up very fast and extremely helpful.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Don't read the reviews from the kids. My wife and I agree this app helps unplug our 11 year old. We have a 2 year so it's hard to monitor electronic usage all the time. We don't have to worry about him waking up in the middle of the night or spending too much time on his tablet. Controlling bedtime and daily allowance was exactly what we were looking for and after 3 months it still works well.,5

I've always monitored her screen time, but this app makes it easier. I can send her a funny message when I've cut her off & it makes for less tension than when i had to physically ask her for it. We have used other parent programs in the past that caused her tablet to freeze or blocked things it shouldn't have, those things have not happened with this app.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I warn you.....  Do not get this app for an iPad. It kept deleting all my son's apps as he was in the middle of playing. And this was during the time frame he was allowed to use his device. It was getting really frustrating every time he got booted off. You have to go back into the screen time app and hit a button to restore all apps every time you get booted. AWFUL! I had to finally uninstall the app. And now all my son's apps are no longer in folders. He has to go back and resort everything.,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Fantastic app for parents to monitor and having control over screen time regardless of where the device might be. The fact that kids don't like it is testament to the app doing exactly what it should - controlling access to phones at all times. Whether it be setting the times of use, limiting the amount of time spent on their phone, blocking or allowing only certain apps to be used during school time this is a very easy and straight forward app to use. I was initially sceptical of the app's claims but having tested it fully during the free trial period I was totally sold and now subscribe to it's services.",5

Pros - I can shut it down when needed; I can allow only certain apps to run (like math and reading apps) at certain times; I can set limits to how much time they are on the system for one app (like YouTube) but allow unlimited time on others (like math and reading apps) Cons - None (for me, my kids may tell you different) Since installing this app, the usage has gone down dramatically, they are playing outside and with their friends more and are engaged in the real world. My only wish is if it could work with my smart tv (kids have realized they can stream on the tv) wish I could limit that too! Frankly it your kids hate it then it is working well!

I understand the business need to charge monthly, but there isn't really a lot more to improve on. Most people just want what it offers now and would be content paying just once.

A big plus for me is that every time my children download a new app, I get an email, with a link to the app, and can block it if I choose to!  Only 2 things would make it better - more specific details for apple products and most especially - being able to link all devices a child's devices to her daily limit.

This app has eliminated the job I hated of constantly monitoring what apps my kids are using, how long they have been on their devices, and keeping them off of them when I need them to be off!    We hope in the near future that the daily limit feature is updated to be spread across multi-devices. I also would love to see a safe browser added to this.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"If not for this app, my child's brain might literally rot from overexposure to horrible youtube videos.  With the app, we laid some ground rules and she is warned that she had limited time every day.   Usually very little drama when the app cuts her off, surprisingly.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to use.  Great result for our kids.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Ooooh,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Screentime is the best parental control software that I have found. Being able to control my child's tablet from mine from anywhere is very clever.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Most effective screen time monitoring app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It is good at keeping me at task or as a annoying punishment, but still: parents. You would know. This application sometimes goes awry though: I disabled the 'can override other apps' (Can't block an app) and it went into a loop, requesting permission until my system noticed and rebooted and now the entire application UI is huge. Also, some things like creating another user can prevent the app from blocking the application. This also goes with disabling internet. Good, but some things this just can't block.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is amazing it has given me a sense of no worries free it tells me everything, i dont actually read 90% of the things but its nice to give your children their own private time. But just knowing that if i suspect or see something fishy this app can tell me. Its a good piece of mind. I dont do it to spy but to protect him from todays tech its crazy and dangerous. Would definitely recommend.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Easily accessible, relatively user friendly, great updates concerning usage, and good features. Quick customer service was a plus. Well worth the money.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Even the free version of this app is great. I can see what my kids are doing online even when they go hide in their rooms or when I'm at work. I hope anyone researching this app will notice that all the 1 star votes are from kids that are unhappy to have their parents doing their jobs!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Yes my kids don't care for it but its great way to start and stop apps when they are hiding with their device.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Brilliant app kids hate it and I get the things done they need to do.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I hate it because it doesn't give me enough phone time,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Fantastic app!  Great capability to block new apps that are installed.  If they tamper with the app you get an email.  You can select which apps they can use during school hours and setting time limits on apps.  It's nice to be able to add extra time for special occasions.  Chores done, homework ready, no school tomorrow, add an extra hour to their play time without wrecking your normal schedule.  Your kids are smart and can figure out how to defeat any parental controls (gee - use a friends phone!) if they really want to.  But installing this has helped set the tone for conversations about good time management and appropriate content and behavior online.  Your kids have unfettered, unlimited access to everything you don't want to imagine.  You can't block it all, but you can use a tool like this to set boundaries and talk about why.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I can control when and what they use. I can block apps, set timers, restrict content, and see what they are doing. They can request more time for good behavior. My husband and I both have the parent app on our phones, with the child app on two tablets and soon a phone. We love it and would highly recommend it to anyone with kids and electronics. Thank you Screen Time!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great product.  Gives me total control over what my kids can do and when.  I can review their activity to see what they have been up to.  Two boys 7 and 8 have gotten used to the time limits and now decide themselves when to play and manage their own time without me nagging.  Tasks feature is a great way to get the kids to help out in exchange for extra time on their tablets.  Love it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app flat-out works. It prevents the conflicts leading to family problems related to Too Much screen time. I expect that most bad reviews for this app are from the kids who don't like the new restrictions, but as a parent, I can tell you that this is the best app of its type.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app! It is the best control app I've found. I can pause my kids devices when it's time for meals or activities. I can group apps by purpose (we homeschool) so that some apps have free access and others are limited. I get reports on which apps they're using, and they can do chores to earn more time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I would love to be able to preset a schedule in more details for high school age. To stop during class, but allow use during passing time and lunch. Needless to say,,just having the app installed gave me leverage with my child's phone and her study time.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This really does work. You can limit time and app usage in three different ways. I'm so glad I found this app, I was so sick of my daughter laying around on the tablet all weekend and after school. I simply can't watch her all day. I have a life. Thank you so much for creating this app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's too bad that a bunch of entitled children are lowering this app developer's rating.  This app is incredible! For the parents, don't download the Play Store version, Google allows it to be uninstalled. Get the one from their website. It has the admin lock. Kids can still find ways around it, but it makes it exponentially harder. Just don't use a pwd they can easily guess! -Satisfied Dad",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Takes the stress out of managing screen time. We are all happier,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Unlike most parental control apps this app is easy to use and flawless! It allows you to select which apps can be accessed at set times by the children and even has a way to prevent the children from uninstalling the app from their phone. Whenever my children download or uninstall an app, screentime let's me know. It barely takes up any space in the phone and works like a dream! I recommend this app to every parent whose child has a device.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"No longer have to remember to time how long kids are using their tablets, this does it for you.  You can put a time restriction on individual apps or block them completely.  And don't have to worry about if they are quietly using apps they aren't supposed to (ie youtube) after they have used up their time.  Bedtime blocker is great to stop the after bedtime, under the blanket, sneaky usage as well. Love this app!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very HAPPY.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Really motivates my son to do more chores. Gives me great control over the amount of time he spends on his phone. I wish i could use this app on his computer and DS too.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have four children and all of which have electronic devices. Before getting this app they would sneek their devices back in their bedrooms and play on them for hours making it hard for me to awake them. I now have the ScreenTime app and I have set nighttime control which completely blocks them from using their device during bedtime hours. It also alerts me to what my children have searched on the web. As a parent I think it is very important to know what our children are seeing. Thank you Screen Time!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Trial version only. Didn't know or would not have spent valuable time setting up.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is the best app for parents to protect their children on their devices. Works perfectly for me. All the one star ratings are from kids that hate this app, meaning that this app really works.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Absolutely great app for parents monitor and limit screen time.  The low ratings you see are probably just angry kids that have parents that installed the app.  Works flawlessly.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great!  So easy to use and makes getting my kid off their electronics so much easier!  Highly recommend this!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app gives us peace of mind and has the kids doing chores for tablet time. A much happier family all round. Love the daily email summaries too.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Needs support for XBox, and direct parental ok of tasks but otherwise great",4

Have it installed on my son's tablet since about a month and once his daily limit has been reached, he understands that his time is done for the day. Wonderful interface offering a host of different types of controls. Very intuitive and user-friendly app. I highly recommend.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app as it gives me complete peace of mind knowing that my children are completely protected while using their devices.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love how i can limit their time over multiple devices. And the summary at the end of the day is quite useful for me to keep tabs on what the kids have been up to. By far my favorite feature is the fact that they can earn extra time by completing tasks and chores. I am recommending this to all my friends with kids. I would like to see a feature where two kids can use one device and be monitored seperately... maybe 2 kids accounts on one device.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Of course my kids hate it! I like that I have total control over their devices. I make them earn time instead of just being able to log on whenever. I set up bedtimes so they can't sneak extra time. I like that it disables the games when their time is up so they truly play ONLY the time allotted them. This has forced my children to be more active and more proactive with their daily activities. I've had to fight less to get them to do homework, chores, etc. I simply make it a ""task"" if I want it done!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"You can prevent your children from spending all of their time with their phones/tablets. I can only suggest it. It would be ideal to have this same software for Windows, Mac and Linux as well. That would be the ultimate solution for all parents.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Very happy with this app, my kids are 9 & 10 and it's working as it should with their kindles. I rarely pay for apps, but this one is worth every penny. Tough pill for them to swallow at first, but now 60 minutes per day is the accepted norm with no tantrums, which is...really peaceful :)",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's a good app ... I can control the time my kids spend on the Internet. I just wish there is an Arabic version so they can use the task option 😂😂,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I think this is a great app and certainly worth paying the small amount to help keep the peace between kids and parents. I no longer have to pull the tablet out of their 'cold dead hands' which usually causes a crying fest. They understand that when the tablet goes blue, tablet time is over - whether I turn it off from my phone or their time runs out or the set schedule doesn't allow use. My young 4 and 5 year old kids now only get a limited amount of tablet time and usually don't complain about it. They just get up and go find something else to do rather than veg on the couch all day on the weekends.  The tasks are a great way to encourage the kids to help around the house.  My girls get excited when they find out they get 'extra' time - whether they even use it or not. The tasks reinforce that they need to help around the house and clean up after themselves.  Fantastic use case: The girls catch the school bus at 7:25am so at 6:50am the tablet goes off and they know (no harping on them or doing countdowns or taking the tablet away) that it is now time to get dressed and ready for school. Love it! Also, love that I can turn off apps like 'adult' Youtube in favour of YouTube Kids.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Simply disabling background sync has allowed some bypass.  Not perfect.  Could be better.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I don't  buy many apps bit this one is worth it. It allows to control what the kids can access and limited the time spent on tablet or phone. You can easily add time or unblock an app. A desktop version would be great as well as a validation button to make sure the modifications requested have been applied (with a history of modification made). Keep up the good work.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app - the only downside is that there's no desktop version - only phone and tablet are controlled now. Other than this - everything is intuitive, easy to set and control, logical and even comes with a bit of gamification (task and rewards system).",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We replaced our kid's ipad with an android tablet.  This app allows all the options you need for controlling screen time for the android.  I've tried parental controls on the iPad and it's very limited.  Switching to android was the best thing I ever did.  This app is seamless and robust.  I can even control my kids screen time from my phone,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app as it puts me in control of the time that he spends on his tablet.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent for controlling access to your kids' mobile devices including individual apps (so you can block chrome etc to block browsing - for younger kids). What's better is the kids blame the app and not you when things shut down!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Keeps my 7 year old safe!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has been perfect for monitoring my child's phone and limiting her screen time without having to physically take her phone away. Being able to pause her screen time until she finishes homework or chores has worked great. I would highly recommend it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I received a spam email from the company stating they needed me to leave a 5 star rating as they said ( kids leave us one star ratings angry that there parents blocked there devices ) after skimming through the reviews it wasn't truly the case . I like the app and we use it for our children . But the demanding email was to much BS for me.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app!  It has made screen time non-negotiable, which has made my job as mom much easier!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I limited my childs tab time. It always says he's offline when he's not, and very inaccurate measurements of time spent. Such a shame, this app looked promising but simply doesn't work. Would be worth paying for it it worked, nothing else comes even close.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Nice tool to manage the kid's time in front of a screen,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We all love this including my son of 10 ! He's pleased he does more now too.... don't pay attention  to 1* ratings. This is a safe n secure app which helps keeps kids safe... they can't be on their devices hours on end without you knowing what they are doing. All apps they install you can see too. Hats off to you ! Well done.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I work with enterprise IT and have completed a global iPad roll out using some pretty clever tools, but this doesn't really work for controlling what your kids are up to on their tablet devices. Screen Time for Android is a five start app giving control, flexibility and very few foibles ON THE ANDROID VERSION which I thoroughly recommend.   On the iPad it is probably a 3 1/2 star app - but I don't think anything will score higher at the moment because of the way Apple secure thee device. If you have a multi-device household then Screen Time is still good enough, but if you are just (or predominantly) Android then stop looking as you have found what you need.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The app is very complex and hard to use. I tried using it to lock the phones of my 2 children and I keep getting complaints from them as it seems to not unblock anything I would actually allow them to use. Don't get this app.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is great! I no longer have to nag my children to get off the phone and can monitor their usage while travelling for work.  It's also great for controlling and making sure inappropriate apps are not installed. Managing time zones is a little tricky as you have to change it in the childs device app instead of the parental control app.  But that is minor.  Otherwise it had been a huge comfort and stress relief!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,One of the best so far.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I use this app to help my child focus and get things done.  If he does a task he gets app time.  It teaches responsibility and self control.  I have an android phone and can really single out what I will allow him to use and what he has to earn.  I love it!!!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app...it helps a lot....kids didn't like it but job was done,5

So far, it's been the only one that is reward based, allowing my children to earn coveted screen time by doing chores, homework, etc., and is customizable for any family's schedule or value system. Another great feature is that it can be used on multiple devices, even kindles, etc. Also, long distance parents can log in. If the kids take a device with them to their grandparents I can still monitor from my phone at home, etc. Excellent pricing, also! :)",5

We agreed together on how much time he should be allowed per day (1 hour) and what kinds of chores he can do to earn that time.  It's worked wonders.  Now he comes to us asking what he can do to help vs. us having to berate him to get things done.  We couldn't be more pleased with the app.  It's great!",5

Also, along with limiting FUN time, it limits the kid's creativity, makes them become greedy. Creativity needs inspiration that they can do stuff.

Don't get discouraged by angry teens leaving bad reviews.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I downloaded the app. in February 2016 spent the money to use the application. I have two children on this app. Anytime you update  a phone or your system updates this application has major issues.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Originally I had my doubts as I read through some of the reviews (which were not kind), but decided to have a go anyway - 14 day free premium trial, why not?! And I WAS NOT disappointed - this app has changed my family dynamic for the positive. Sure there was anger from the kids, but the app was only there enforcing rules that we have been telling them all year. Flash forward to now: there is no more running around and constantly enforce how much time they should be playing their tablets for and also when they need to put them down (to go to school or go to bed). I would recommend installing the app without setting limits first, monitor the usage to see what's going on first, then set the boundaries in consultation with your children - I went in a little heavy handed and there was an equal force kickback to say the least. The added bonus, you can be sure that you know what your children are interacting with and that the content they're either playing or searching is appropriate for them - I never wanted to be ""big brother"" watching their every move, but I feel much more relaxed that I can check in from time to time just to confirm they're being internet safe.

That is what I really needed because I saw all her friends doing nothing but putting their noses to screens.  I was totally honest and up front about the app when I finally gave her the phone and explained what is was and how I intended to use it.  ""Awe mom, really?'' is what I heard.  But let me tell you, it has been a blessing.  No wondering what she is doing, how much time she is doing it, and what apps she is on (which for a 12yo is not very many at all)  She asks ME for permission to unblock an app if she wants to use for a bit and it goes right back on block.  School time is awesome too, I know she will get in trouble if she is on it so.....it doesn't work when it's not supposed to.  Bedtime, not to worry, phone shuts down period, days over.

It gives me peace of mind. You can also assign tasks for extra time. The experience so far is great.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Parents will love this...kids NOT so much!  With some tweaking of the settings such as what apps to block you will love the control it brings.  Just understand it's the kids that will not like this app and if allowed to rate it they will give the lowest rating possible.  Adults, give the trial version a chance...sadly it's you that will have to deal with your child's extreme displeasure of not having unfettered access to electronics.   Ah, raising children in the 21st century!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"But I do have one gripe, the app freezes often when I'm trying to do something on it.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love that we can see what our kids are downloading, and pause their usage if they aren't doing what they are supposed to be doing. Gives parents a little peace of mind and helps us keep kid phones from running family time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've been using this app for about a month now, and it is superbly useful when it comes to getting your kids off of their electronics and doing what they are supposed to be doing. My kids have complained, tried to find a way to uninstall the companion app, even tried masking what they're doing to get around it. Nothing has worked. There are some features I would like to see added, such as creating additional schedules for the weekends or days off, content filtering, etc. Best app out there for parents.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I hate it,1

One click and done. I love the fact that I can turn on and off specific options such as only allowing them to read after dinner. It's great that kids can earn extra time for chores, definitely less arguments around the house. I feel so much safer with my kids playing on a tablet knowing that this app is installed.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a seriously great. You can monitor your kids use of the phone, block whatever apps you want during schools and bed time, you can pause your kids phone from your phone making all activity stop. I truly love this.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works flawlessly.  I actually installed this and paid the 12-month subscription to block myself getting too addicted to my smartphone and it definitely helps.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is great for managing your kids time on their devices. Having the ability to automatically shut off access at set times is ideal. I would recommend taking the time to explain to your child what the app does and doesn't do as far as their privacy. My daughters were concerned that we were monitoring what they were doing on specific app's, but I explained that we trusted them to use social media responsibly, but just wanted to make sure that they were not spending excessive time on their screens. The only slight negative is that there is no compatibility with older versions of IOS (9 and above only). Great support from the team.",4

My daughter is 10 and while she gets annoyed when she runs out of time, she always jumps at an opportunity to complete one of the many tasks I have added for her, including a morning checklist that has items for brushing her teeth, remembering her glasses, and feeding the pets.

But I wasn't ready to give her complete access to everything at her fingertips. This app allows me to block specific apps at certain times,  block usage after hours,  and it's EASY to navigate. Highly suggest for parents that don't really want your child to *have* a phone,  but they *need* one anyway.  The only thing I would like to see added is a log of messaging history.",5

Probably  my son out smarting me but nonetheless this app should notify  me if and when any changes are made and the parent's  phone should be the only device that can change settings on there kid's device.

I no longer have to yell at them for anything it just takes a second to turn off their devices with a message letting them know what they did.

No more grumpy boy in the mornings with the bedtime setup everything will be block for the entire night so finally our son has a good night sleep and we didn't have to fight with him about turn off his phone, wifi   etc etc every night. The idea in our case is not restrict him the things he likes to do online in his phone or tablet. Our idea is teach him how to use these tools responsibly. With this app we have the opportunity to teach him how to use his time, social media and the internet in a responsibly  way.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app as a parent. My child hates it. That's ok. After complaining she does what she needs to do. Win win. I recommend this to every parent with a child that has a device. It should be on all phones as an option period.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very helpful!! Just what I needed without being too in your face with my kids all the time!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is ideal for all those families where the kids spend too long staring at screens! The ability to limit the total amount of time, to set a curfew before bedtime, and to pause devices for mealtimes is superb! We no longer have the whine of ""5 more minutes"" (which is always more like 15!) because Screen Time stops internet access before we have to nag! And the boys are learning to monitor their own usage. Perfect!!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a review from a parent- I have used this app for a few weeks now, and it has made my life so much easier. My 14 year old son will play on his phone for hours and hours if I didn't set limits. Sleep and homework do not have the same allure as the games on his phone, so instead of buying a ""dumb phone"" I got this app. It took a little time figuring out how this app works, but now that I know how to use it I am happy to pay for it. My son now has 30 minutes to play games, but has full access to phone snd texting. I can contact him when I need to because he has not had the phone taken away since we downloaded this app. Any app deemed necessary by a parent can be used at anytime, while games and YouTube can be limited. This is one smartly designed app !",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"the digital world had taken a hold on my son's life.  we squared away his pc with windows 10 screen time option that is built in, but his phone was still a big issue.  after trying out screentime for a few days, i knew immediately it was the app we needed.  being in hi-tech for the last 24 years, i had a few immediate questions like could he uninstall the app (not with the version you get from the website), could he change the system time to manipulate his playing time (not if i disable settings), other questions...and screentime labs support was always VERY QUICK and informative regarding all my concerns.  screentime is fairly granular; can block specific apps, has a bedtime blocker that can block selected or all apps during bedtime, the same goes for schooltime as well...during school time i leave open apps like calculator, phone, and whatsapp (for now, as long as i see he doesn't abuse that during school time) so he can do his studies and contact us in emergencies.  i simply set screentime app to allow these apps once his school is scheduled to let out for the day and he can play any app i haven't  blocked until the bedtime blocker kicks in.  1 million likes for this app!!",5

We chose to have a conversation with our child and together setup a working schedule that we as parents could live with.  While he is not happy necessarily with the limitations, he at least knows that WE put the limits on his phone and not some random evil app.  He knows that WE have the ability to give him more time and WE control everything he can do on the phone.  He earns every minute he gets on it and it is working out.  Without Screen Time, there was a fight just about every day.  Sneaking the phone.  More usage than we wanted.  Lying about it.

This however, gives the parent complete control over the amount of time and on what apps.  It also allows certain ""tasks"" to be assigned and if done, allocate more time as an incentive.  This has been extremely useful.  The only objection I have to the program is that if you have multiple devices, you can't program different time allocations - for example, 1 hour per day for a tablet and only 30 min. per day for a phone.  Unless we don't understand how it works it appears to allocate whatever time you specify equally to all devices.  Other than that, it's easy to use, intuitively designed and works beautifully.",5

I'd love it even more if it had some more features because (there are reasons), due to needing added safety, we utilize 2 apps for his phone. The 2nd app we use is MSpy, simply because it does have some features that Screen Time does not have. Some of the features include, location tracking, I can view all his texts (the actual texts) & phone calls I see who he calls & who calls in, etc. If we did not have some added safety issues (compared to the average person), Screen Time would be more than enough for us! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it, it would just be added LOVE with he extra features! And my son gets so frustrated with it, which tells me it's doing it's job.

My child did not like it at first when I installed the app.  but we talked about why I put it on her phone and she understands. I also like the task features. I've gotten more choirs done from my child. Only one thing I would like is a location finder on this app. I put this app on my child's phone because I am a concern parent and children do not need to be obsessed over their phones or tablets.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,IT IS A VIRUS ALL PARANTS BEWARE,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I hate it because it works!!!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love how easy this app is to use. It really works, even has my son completing tasks for more screen time!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love that I can control / limit the use of their cellphones,  block certain apps,  reward them with extra time when they complete chores etc.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,A wonderful app to protect our children from the evil things that bring corruption.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have tried several parental control apps and I can honestly tell you that this one is the best by far! It is amazing in the level of detail it provides on a child's usage. There are various controls like bedtime, school time, meal pauses, etc. I do not foresee ever going to a different app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We downloaded this app back when it was free and then when it became a paid app we decided to try other free apps that were available. However, after arguing with our child all summer about screen use and hearing arguments about the various apps we tried we gave up. Our child even asked us to go back to this app since it was seamless - it doesn't change the main pages of the tablet, it gives warnings to when the time is up and allows us to give tasks for more time. We love the communications about what apps are being used and for how long and most of all we love not yelling about tablet use!!! We are amused by all the 1 star reviews from children and actually those reviews are what prompted us to try this app to begin with! If the kids hate it - it is the perfect parent app!!! You will not be disappointed - it is worth every single cent!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,But the mum loves it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Result: Chores are done... It is a miracle :),5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app provides the fine tune controls I need to make sure that my kids are using their phones appropriately. I love the extra time award system built in. If you see negative reviews here it is more than likely the kids who don't like being subjected to any kind of guidance.  Only change I would like to see is adding in controls for widgets,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have a little 5 yr old and in July treated him to a tablet, purely for playing games & education. I installed ' Screen Time' from the word go and wondered if it would be worth the investment. The next day I recvd a call from my boy's school saying he was not well and collected him early pm. He seemed alert and I didn't notice any problems. He said on arrival home, ""I am OK now, can I play on my tablet!?"" Whaaaa??? I gave him the tablet, which would not allow play, of course. Thanks Screen Time😉",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It has promise.  A few things that need addressed are  -- Facebook messenger headless chat isn't locked down     (This one for me is a deal breaker, sadly)  -- I can see what sites have been browsed and what has been searched, but there is no way to filter sites/searches moving forward.  -- Play Time Gives minutes/Hours so kids can use device for say one hour strait through, the clock keeps ticking whether they are on or off the device. Where as Tasks Gives Time that only gets measured as the kids USE the device.  This creates confusion. I think there should be only one bucket of Time, that gets taken from as kids USE their devices.  More over, Be it Play time or Tasks completed, Time should optionally rollover to the next day, it is after all a reward - why should it expire?  If you can get past all that, its not a bad app.  I like the split functionality between the parent controls and the kids interface.  Once I got used to how the time worked it did a decent job of keeping things locked down, a few bugs crept up here and there but for the most part it worked as expected with exception to Facebook Messenger.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does what I bought it for 😁,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Helped get our daughters tablet usage under control. Only complaint is that it does not seem possible to perform parental functions without the tablet being connected to the internet,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's a breeze after I found this wonderful app. Now I can manage my son's time from his gadget and only to approve what app suit him best. Great job!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I used to love it now my kids can bypass it...thinking of discontinuing my account. I've tried to Uninstall and reinstall many times thinking I'm doing something wrong but maybe it's not on my end. Please help.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Really great App, easy to use, does exacty what is needed. Have been using for over a year now, so my boys have no problem accepting our 'house' rules, supported by Screen Time functionality.  Recently upgraded to premium and enjoy the benefits such as remote control over three users. Fun also to see messages from my boys negotiating for more time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,this is the most frustrating convoluted app with incorrect instructions and dumb procedures that don't work leaving the parent with a ton of wasted time with nothing to show for it.  tks screen time labs for wasting my time.,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,No support for browser history. Please fix that issue.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has allowed me to get my kid's device usage under control.  After experimenting for about a month with shared profiles, I ended up getting each child their own Android tablet and installing Screen Time on each. I then changed the passwords on the other household devices.  One of the differentiating features is the ability to assign tasks and to then reward users with more time as they complete them.  Now only after doing their math and reading can they watch videos etc.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It work very will. I can use it with out any problems and i do not use computer or smart phone easily.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Im so happy with this app so far, it eases alot of stress in my household. Kids dont like it all the time but they love the reward system. I highly recomend.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Awesome app,  works great.  Support is fantastic as well.  Twice my son has figured out how to bypass screen time and both times support has helped me lock it down.  Any bad reviews are just angry kids.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best parental app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a terrible app. Not only does it let parents have full control over their kids, it lets them peek on personal info such as name, address, and phone number as well as what they do on the app. This app is a menace to society and is more private than Hillary Clinton.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Bed time blocker... Time limits... Msgs while in use... No more sneaky feet in the middle of the night  because my kid knows the blocker is on... And. Now the bedroom is clean because tasks allows my kid to earn more time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This has helped me limit my daughter's screen time without (too much) fuss. I can lock any apps I don't want her using (and change them whenever,) plus  it will shut down her usable apps after a time period I set (and at times for bed, school, or whatever.) Plus, there's an easy on/off for the restrictions so I can make exceptions (waiting times, car rides,etc.)",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Screen time is an awesome app, it gives to parents information on type and time of your kids phone usage. I wish this app was pre-installed on kids phones!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a must have app if you have children with devices. It will make your job much easier and reclaim your children.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. Since I started using it my son is more productive during the day learning responsibility and time management.  We don't argue about his phone and it allows me to ensure he can access apps that are appropriate for different times. Best app for me and my family:),5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Highly recommend!  My kids get online and they won't get off. I love that even though I work midnights I can monitor what they are on and turn it off so they go to bed.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Must-stalled app for parents,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I sent a pause and it dident take effect. Both phones were updated. What could the problem be??? Unhappy parent.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Looked very promising at the beginning, apps went away but then they never came back for more than a few minutes.  Fiddled with the times and settings, enabling/disabling, finally up went the white flag and uninstalled.  I know apples are very particular about being controlled, but the app's idiosyncrasies were it's downfall.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great App only negative things come form the kids who post bad reviews as they are unable to do what they want.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My daughter hates this app and probably gave it a bad review.  That should tell you how well it works.  I did have some issues in the beginning with her hacking into my phone and fb to change settings, but I put a password on my phone, log off the computer when I am done and we had a talk with her.  I love how you can see what she is up to at any time off the day and I really like the task feature.  I can assign tasks and when she completes then I can give her more time.  I would recommend this app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It great app I don't not what to do without it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love that I control when my kids get access to their apps and for how long they get access to those apps. I have total control.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Installed this app and used as a pay service for a while. Then noticed it is no longer effective,  my 9 years old using a phone, while usage time  is not registered. Several months exchange with support with no results. Until one day I found that my son using his phone in safe mode, bypassing screen time. After I notified support, I got sorry and link to the article with workaround. Phone need to be encrypted  and multiple profiles has to be set up. Use other apps or you will be fooled by your child.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is amazing!!! I'm showing it off to all of my friends who are concerned about what their kids  are doing in their devices! My son has finally learned that he is just a kid and it is my top priority to keep his welfare first and foremost. You guys keep up the good work!!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has been a life-saver.  It allows me to be less frantic in oversight and management of the amount of time he spends on screens and the apps he uses.  It has helped us be very clear about expectations.  I highly recommend it.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works well.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a fantastic app. It lets me not only control time on the device but I can specify which apps are active. Love it.  My child does not really like it but I have seen better behaviors and response to chore times because of the app.  Thanks developers.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Simple it works.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Had a quick question and they reply back in seconds...         They get the job done!!!!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I am eighteen years old and just moved out of the house. My parents still have control over me,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I think.it is a good app to monitor my child . Easy to use,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We love this app. My 2 older children were reluctant at first but are now on board  (although they still complain a little) this puts me back in control without having to constantly be monitoring them. I have recommended this too many of my friends as I love it ❤,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Trying to teach our children about appropriate online boundaries is a constant up hill battle.  This app allows us to set those boundaries while they are learning and then adjust as necessary.  Not only that, it has helped to foster great conversations about why this ""basic app that all my friends have"" actually is not healthy for them and the ad content is completely inappropriate for a 13 year old.  Love this app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is great I love the features but would like more features such as web browsing blocking,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Our kids hate it, but we love it. Keep up the awesome work!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"A simple and effective app allows you to monitor and if necessary, control time spent and apps used on your child device. It also came in handy when the device was misplaced and we could see when it was last used and figure it where that would of been.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Does its job,  reasonably priced.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My children tell me I ""take the fun out of everything"" which is certainly not my goal in life, but as their parent my job is to set limits.  Screentime enables me to do exactly that without constantly watching the clock, worrying about inappropriate apps being installed, and wondering if my kid is online at midnight instead of getting much needed sleep.    Terrific app.  For all the children out there who are whining about this app being installed on their devices, go out and play...play sports, games, read a BOOK, have a real live conversation.  You will be better kids/teens for it!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app.  Time controls have been a great tool to limit our kid's tablet use, and the tasks (to request more time) are a great incentive for kids.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app works perfectly and allows my wife (iPhone) and me (Android) to control our son's phone. Every function we need has worked exactly as expected. Because it's so clear our son hasn't objected because he knows the limits and can check on them so no surprises. I contacted support twice with detailed questions and both times I received answers within a couple of hours that were just what I was looking for. Flawless.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Very well thought through app to help control our kids' screen time. I love the ability to limit certain apps, but allow others beyond time limits. Having the ability for kids to earn and request reward time remotely is great.   Thank you!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have two kids and I used this app on their Galaxy Tab S. No wonder why they hate this app so much, but now, I can control the app remotely and can even give them some   rewards after some of their good jobs. Love this app.  However, I prefer to have more features on tracking log of YouTube, the app they use most.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good easy to use and it works!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app helps me limit my kids screen time and make sure they go to bed when they need to and don't watch utube until late into the night. Really like the feature where I can allow school / educational apps when they have no play time left. I would  recommend it to parents especially if kids have access to wifi or spend to much time on their tablets,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Kids mostly don't like it and depends on what stage of development they are at, will respond differently.  As long as this is to reinforce limits that has already been communicated, this is very helpful.  The paid version makes the time limit real without you needing to do more.  Even the information from the free version takes away guess work and helps parents gather real information on usage and have discussions accordingly.  Nothing can substitute the work of parenting, but this is a very very helpful tool in our gadget-crazed times. Thank you.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I like this app & really like the task feature. I can set fun positive task like tell 5 positives about your day/you, along with the day to day chores,homework,ect... my only wish is for a better option for always allowed contacts, instead of having to create shortcuts. A great app if used in a postive way and NOT a punishment. I explained to my teen daughter this is not a punishment but a better way to help her become more responsible without me constantly reminding/nagging her & to better our relationship",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love how I can get notifications on my phone, approve tasks, even have them send me a pic to prove that the task has been completed.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is great. It does a great job of limiting my child's access to unwanted apps and great time limits.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Excellent app for limiting screen time.  Initially, my kids were frustrated when they couldn't be phone zombies every spare minute.  They've learned to manage their phone time better now and have gotten used to it.  The app level control is great, so we can limit social media, games, etc but not restrict texting and other ""essential"" tasks.  Tried a couple of different apps and definitely liked this one best.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Without doubt the best 'parental control' app on the market. I have tried many, many apps but this one really work exceptionally well and although the kids hated it at first, they quickly got used to the restrictions. I was able to remotely control apps, screen time and settings without needing to touch their tablets. It is an app that has been thought-through and comprehensively covers almost any problem. To date, the boys haven't event attempted to break it or bypass it which they managed to work out with other similar apps I tested. Very pleased indeed.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Excellent app, allows me to safeguard my son and ensure I have control on the amount of time he spends on his tablet.  Like being able to set tasks for him to earn more time. Really useful gor parents whose kids take android phone to school as you can block the use of apps during school time.  Can also set time when they are allowed to use it.  Have suggested to the administration team that it would be useful to be able to set concequences for not completing tasks where time is taken off.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has been a great way to monitor and control tablet and app usage of our two small kids, particularly when in the care of their grandparents. The only problem I've noticed is that it occasionally does not track/monitor usage. This may be linked to low battery status, I'm planning on investigating further.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,its so nice to be able to enforce the usage policy for the kid's tablet,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We have had this app installed on our Sons tablet for just over 6 months and it's working exactly as advertised.  Prior to its installation we had difficulty keeping tabs on his use both during and out of school hours.  This application has allowed us to permit him to enjoy the tablet playing games he loves while ensuring it's use doesn't monopolize his other activities and ensuring that offline hours (nights and during class) are properly observed.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We have used this for about 3 months now. At first it we thought it was only effective because it was new. 3 months later and it is still amazing. Changed the whole dynamic of our household even recommended it to some friends with kids. Love this app. Thanks so much for making it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,There billion ways to hack/deinstall the other app,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a really good app - my son is very young but very much into his tablet. With this I can limit his time looking at a screen and get him into a routine, especially when it comes to bedtime as all apps will close for lights out. It has led to him reading more, complaining less and things are (generally!) less of a struggle. I really recommend parents install the app or at the very least use the trial to see for themselves.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,What is the app for checking messages we can use along side this,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Good, working as expected",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,When I first tried this app two years ago I was looking for a better way to control the time allowed. It perfectly delivered. Then I discovered that features I thought I would never use are becoming the best part. I have now banned quite a few apps with the kids getting older and bolder. I like getting the notifications when my kids download new apps. I can decide whether or not to allow them immediately. I like being able to pause so that they will get moving on completing household tasks. I like being able to see their web histories right on my own device. What this app does for a small price is so valuable. I recommend it to every parent I know who buys an electronic device for a child and asks for advice about safety.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Parents please ignore the negative comments or ratings, these are coming from kids that doesn't like us having so much control!

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,A great app for controlling the amount of time my two kids spend on their samsung tablet (we earlier got rid of their iPad due to lack of parental controls although I think that screen time has a work around that also allows it to be used on an iPad too). Screen time helps you avoid many of the battles with your screen addicted kids and encourages them to do positive tasks (if they want to earn extra time).,5

Seriously, I was really frustrated about the screentime my kids were having and no real way to limit that with Kindles without having to go to a child's account, which takes most of their storage.

I set ""Read 20 minutes a day"", ""Do something for someone that makes them smile"" and ""Exercise with Daddy or Mommy"" as some of the things they can do to earn extra time. Also there is an option to override the time limit for trips in the car (vacation etc.) or to take all screentime away for a set amount of time for any reason. I have used both. I recommend this app because it works and 90% of the people saying that it doesn't work, are probably the children themselves rating it poorly because they're upset that the app really does what it is supposed to do. This mom is very happy with this app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Just a fantastic app. The bad reviews are clearly from kids frustrated they can't do whatever they want. My kids love it because I don't have to confiscate their phones anymore and they can work for extra time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I am a parent installing thjs on my child's tablet and it is wonderful! I am able to control my kids usage and best...banned youtube for my 6yo as he learnt some vugularities from the videos! For all parents,i strongly recommend!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My son's tablet usage was excessive..he knew it and I knew it. Screentime has helped a lot! My son doesn't argue when his time is up..he knows he's had enough for the day. I would recommend it to any parent experiencing the same thing.,5

My daughter is 15 and YES I keep her away from all the negative internet mess with this app... I love this app and I thank God for it. People need to understand how much unnecessary crap your kids have access to when owning a smart phone. Thank you creaters for this app... Trully amazing!!! Also works with pads!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love that I have the ability to monitor my kids on their tablets. It a relief not having to hover over them or argue about getting off.

I can also block certain apps that I don't want them to go to. It's a fantastic app and I am so grateful ScreeTime exists! Every parent who cares about what their children what they are exposed to, should use this  app!",5

My 16 year old son was frustrated at first, but working together we've made this work for us. He's now twice told me how he likes how he better manages his time and doesn't get 'lost' in his phone. It IS NOT a substitute for parenting. Nothing is. I've customized apps which are on/off and the bedtime hours. The ability to make those adjustments for each child is why this is a fantastic app!

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is an good app but my kids just created guest accounts to circumvent it entirely. (Took them about 3 days to figure it out) I mentioned this to the developer but never received a response.  Unfortunate but perhaps by posting this publicly the developer will resolve quickly.,3

He actually likes it and I've had no complaints and moaning from him when the time runs out (which happened when I used to tell him verbally to get off his tablet).,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I think it is a very good app. it really controlls the kid's devices. Very good instrument. Still expecting the time limit for all devices.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is awesome for parents. I love the time reward for tasks completed feature, complete with ability for the kids to send me photographic proof. Takes a little bit of getting used to, but very worth it if you want to control the amount of time your child is on their device and to control the apps they use. Thanks screen time, without you, my kids wouldn't be using their KIndle Fires....  and they say Yeah to that",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I am a mom of 2 boys on cell phones and this is by far the BEST app I have used. I can monitor what my kids are doing and set limits and set bed time restrictions. Much less of a fight than asking your kids to hand their phones over. I also believe it has taught them to be more ""careful"" on what they are doing because they know mom is watching. I highly recommend this app and the support staff has been amazing in answering questions and listen to feedback!! THANK YOU",5

Also i no longer have to tell my child something 5 times bc he's not listening and zoned into his tablet. I simply open my parent app, press pause and write go pick up ur toys or shower time. Its amazing how much faster my son does it and less drama and yelling on my part. The monthly or annual subscription is worth every penny! Love this app! So easy to use!",5

Yeah, she rails and cries against it pretty regularly, but a lot less than she did when I was the bad cop!  Get this app! Super flexible, carefully thought-out, and does everything I need it to. Absolutely worth paying for the premium version to control the details like bedtime blocker versus total daily time limits, blocking by app (I leave her camera accessible, for example), and super easy ways to give her extra time.

Highly customizable where you can limit the amount of time spent daily on the device and can establish specific time periods where the apps are blocked such as bedtime and school time. You can choose which apps are blocked and which are allowed during certain blocked times.  Changes can be made remotely through the website or parent app which can be helpful if an app needs to be temporarily unblocked and I don't have access to the actual device.  App used to be free, but even though there's a charge, it is nominal compared to similar apps.  Well worth the small price to keep control of my child's device.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app for help keep control of my child would really recommend,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Useful for limiting kids time on their devices, well designed, good value too.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I used this app for my kids to turn lock the tablet at night time. I stopped using it for 6months and now when I reinstall the bedtime blocker is now behind premium account when it used to be free. The app itself is good but there are workarounds like creating a new profile on the tablet or using widgets.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Trash,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My kids absolutely hate this app, but I love it! It gives me all the control. I won't lie, it causes serious meltdowns, but it's still worth every penny.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Makes a significant positive impact on managing and controlling my two children and their android devices.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This sets clear boundaries, so that we don't have to fight the same things over and over again.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a very well thought out app with great versatility and customer service. If you are looking for a way to monitor the many devices children can access this app is for you. I highly recommend it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,App works great on all my kids device's. The trial was amazing enough and encouraged me to get the subscription. Do wish it was a bit cheaper. Other then that I believe it's well worth it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We were having a tough time managing the usage of our kids phones and tablets. Found this and tried it out. Not only do we now have the ability to limit their time on electronics, they now complete the chores we have assigned them without having to ask just to get their bonus time. This app is a must have for every family concerned about what their kids are doing on their mobile devices.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Tried it, decided I didn't want it, playing hell removing from my child's phone.  Won't let me remove the device administrator keeps popping up and still showing on the phone and keeping control even after I managed to uninstall",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The free trial was great. But now all my settings are locked down and held for ransom.  I have to pay for premium to undo the settings. The free version has very little to offer in terms of parental control of screen time. There are much better options out there.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app works really well for us. Two you ger kids have  a limit but they are really motivated to earn extra time with task we set. This rangesfrom doing something kind to revision etc It's taken the stress out of phones for me.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have 3 daughters aged 11, 9 and 6. I have discussed the rules and shown them how I configure the restrictions. They can see that it is fair and are party to the setting of the rules. We used to have uncomfortable arguments that uncovered distrust in how we observed usage and how much usage of screen time was going on. This app have spared us lots more of those discussions.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My kid thought this app was a great idea, as he realized that some of the apps on his phone took time away from important stuff like home work and getting chores done so he had to time to see friends. No more bickering and arguing over time spent on games and videos.  Some apps can be used at all times, some apps have a time limit and a few are blocked all together.  It is absolutely worth it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love how you can see each app they have used and for how long. It's also great to have control over how long or if they can access anything on their devices. I'm very impressed with the control this have given back to us without having to take the devices away.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Shows Web history, limits time and apps and much more. Every parent can rest easy thanks to Screen time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I deleted this after 48 hours of it not doing what it promised, every feature failed. My son uses iPhone 6s and I'm on Android.  Very disappointed because the user interface is simple and intuitive. I was hoping to go premium....but not.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I recommend this application as it helps both parents and children in regulating how much screen time is appropriate for electronic devices being used. Thank you for providing this good tool.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Really recommend this to all parents,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"DOWNLOAD THIS YOUR CHILD WILL ""LOVE"" IT",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Why do u hav 2 of the same app? O_o,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Really the great app. I am very impressed. Previously I bought a premium plan. Later then I found that many of the benefits are already available in free plan, so I reverted to free plan. However still premium plan have many extra and great features. I  am using this app for my kids of 5 years old. For now I am using there free plan since last year. I'm very happy with them. As I am using there free services, so I am thinking to make a donation to their organization, but still have not found link of donation. May be they accept or not! Finally I wish the Screen Time the best! Thanks",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Nice app to control my child's screen time!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app. Not only can I control how much time my son spends on his tablet, I can see what he's doing (even from my work), and he can't play apps he downloads unless I approve them.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is excellent. It allows my child enough freedom to have fun and connect with friends and family while also keeping her safe and giving me peace of mind!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it! I have little ones on 2 different tablets and this makes it so much easier for them to be responsible with their time limits. The educational ones I leave unrestricted and the games are monitored well with this app!!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The best thing for a parent! If this app has bad reviews it is from frustrated kids only. I have been using this for my two boys and it has cut out all th drama from my life!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great flexibility and reporting,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a great app!!! I don't have to fight my son's phone for time time with him, and the program is easy to use.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It helps manage time consuming screen activity because the theory of the relativity works they experience differently how time flies, screen time helps kids also do something else too.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great to regulate all my kids. Time to play outside! !!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a parent, I can't say enough good about this app. I am able to control when and how long my kids are on their devices, and I can see exactly what they are doing. It has proven invaluable already, and I've only had it a couple weeks. It has gotten some bad reviews from kids lately, which should tell you something! My son hated it at first too, but he's getting used to it. It's more about not having unlimited use of his devices than the app itself.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I like it , i know what they playing most of time",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I found it really easy to use. And it's very effective. My daughter has attitude - pause. My daughter doesn't want to do her chores - pause. She hates that. But on the flip side, my daughter does something great or is being extra helpful, I can reward her or add extra time just by pressing ""play"".  I also like the additional safe guard of automatically blocking all new downloaded apps. This gives me time to review and approve the ones that are appropriate. And the separate school time setting is great!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's annoying, but better than the last one my mom installed. At least this one allows me to earn additional play time. And I'm glad there is a separate setting for school. It was hard for me to get used to it at first, I was just mad my mom didn't trust me. But now I don't even care.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app.  No more struggle to get him off the ipad!  Once his time is up...it's done.  Allows for a more peaceful transition to another activity.  And I love how I can see what he's doing in real time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app, has helped me out heaps, daughter kept changing settings on her tablet and doing crazy things, now she can't!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The free time granted is slightly delayed, so the kids complain of not receiving the play time even after 10mins.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. I have full control of on the time that kids spend on this app. Best app I have brought in the last couple of years definitely!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Does what it says,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This has has given me back control over my kid's after they were taken over by technology. I've got my premium family time back. Initially the kids were grump and did not speak for a day or two but with a few reward times we are back to normal. I love this app despite a few hiccups which I trust will be sorted. Thank you.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This has helped make our children more like children, instead of electronic consuming obsessed little people. We setup the guest to have restrictions on the Samsung tablet as our daughter tried to gain more time until she quickly realised we stopped her. We love the bedtime blocking feature too.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very effective parental control. Easy to setup and use. Intuitive user interface. Highly recommended.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have total control over what my son is playing and for how long. He hates it, so I consider that a win! 😂 Excellent app and I can highly recommend it for all parents.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is great for people who like to stalk their kids, annoy them more than anything they will experience in their lifetimes, and it will do the exact opposite of what the app was intended to do. Instead of cooling down their addiction to games, by limiting it, you yourself will fuel their addiction and in turn, the kids will spend every single minute (sorry every screen time minute because every screen time minute is equal to about 15-30 seconds in real time) playing games and parents taking it away",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very good app for controlling your kids mobile and tablet usage. Simple and intuitive interface.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The fact that kids are on here complaining about the app is proof positive how well it works!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best app ever... No more shouting at my children to turn their tablets off. Daily limit is set and when times up that's it!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Took a bit to get my head around its workings at first, but now find it very useful. Would have liked to use app store for payment thought as price is in $US",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This allows me to control what my son does with his free time. I know all the apps he downloads and what games he is playing. It is a wonderful app to keep your kidos safe!! Will by it over and over!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Screen Time is an AWESOME app for parents!! I know exactly what my kids are doing on their cells/tablets and for how long. I can block use for bed time, school time or any other time if I want/need to. (If they're on punishment, for example.) They can still make calls in case of emergencies, which is great. My kids complained when I installed it, but oh well. I pay for it, my rules. Can't say enough good things about SCREEN TIME!!!! (Yes, kids may hate it, but that means it must be working right?!) Lol.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This has given my daughter the freedom she wants while giving me the peace of mind I need,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great App. Once kids accept the time allocations it eliminates all arguments and promotes time negotiations.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Reduces family argument. The ability to pause the children's phone for lunch is great and the instant ability to add time for cooperation is really effective!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Just does what I needed! ! :0),5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We wanted to see how much time our kids were spending on their tablets.  This app met that need but also provided much more. You can limit their time,  award additional time if they complete projects, etc and one of my favorite things is being able to view web search history.  There's more to life than what is on a screen.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best parent app out there. I have used many different ones and this is the best one out there. I love that I can see what they are doing and if their bad one click and no phone.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works as advertised!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,MATURE ENOUGH TO NOT USE THIS       so it's too expensive for a an app that doest need to be installed when you can be responsible like me but 😐 why would ya wanna waste memory on you Acer for this ? It's not worth it at all !,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app . Didn't really like installing it but seems to be only way to stop my child spending hours on his phone .,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My kids hate screentime because it works. It is a great tool. I set it and forget it until one of the children  is out of time and ask to do a chore. Now  they need to create a Windows version.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I downloaded this app as a trial and soon realised that it did everything I needed. The beauty of this app is the ability to set tasks so your child can earn extra time on their tablet. My 9 year hates do her homework so she can earn an extra 20 mins per day if we agree it's done. If you see a 1* rating on here I'll bet it's from a child and that means it's working,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Exactly what I was looking for,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Ok service when I used it.. However, I was charged for 9 months of service and wasn't using it.. never received an email or invoice.  It's not right to continously charge blindly for this long.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is the best parental application I've used. I tried several. This gives me the best control.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I downloaded the trial and after it was over I immediately purchased it for my two kids. My oldest is addicted to her phone and won't do chores. This app controls every aspect of her phone and makes her do chores to gain more time. It works out perfectly and if you have a child that is always on their phone, give this a shot.  It's worth it",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Would give 5 stars if it could work with apple products better.  Also would be nice to work with laptops (windows). Maybe it does. Just haven't worked it out yet. I like the idea of rewarding kids with extra time if chores or outside time have been completed. Kids spend way to much time on their devices. Parents mainly to blame but it is a great baby sitter for busy parents. This app helps reduce online time and rewards them for been active.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Has many great features and keeps the peace in my household,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great for parents that are cautious about giving kids a phone. you can moitor, accept new installs, set chors for more time and much more! My wife and I tried others and this is the one I bought the full version of. works for us and why not try it, its free",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I mean... ScreenTime does what it should. ST hides downloaded apps once the parenting restrictions are in place. ST does not remove or deletes apps ! This is not a hacked app. Kids would love for you to think ST is hacked so parents wont lock them down. Lol. Hacked is not the case, for this app. This app does create a VPN and may use a lot of data. 3 stars for data usage and support.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is by far the best parental control to I've come across and loved so much I subscribed to the service.  You have complete control over your kids applications.  Notifications about apps they download,  control usage times and you can even extend privilege times if they complete our determined tasks.  You can control which apps they can use and can't use (I have an 11 year old and continue to block YouTube and Facebook which are pre installed on her phone and can't be removed).  Totally worth every Penny",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is great! It really helps children reduce their wasted time. Almost everybody who gave a bad rating is a child who is angry of being controlled. Well, I think instead of the app being punished, parents should be blamed for dictating their children to use this app. In our family, we reached a friendly agreement with the children before installing this app and it is truly helping us.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Plz add group of apps (e.g. all gaming) time limit and time slot availability. Plz add ability to remotely grant temporary access to app for a customized time.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Changed all our approached with how much times our kids are spending on their tablet. The best feature we are now using is the task. We have no time allowance anymore and just tasks to be complete. Great way to also to fun stuff with our boys and then they get a reward.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,And good for kids too even if they don't think so.  I can set limits on just the one app I don't want them playing on all day and leave the rest.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works on both Android  and Apple devices.  Was not sure if it would be useful  when first downloaded, but after trial period cannot be without  it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,No longer do I have to take my son device when he takes to long to do something I said like take out the trash. Now I just go to my phone and pause his phone for a few minutes until the chore is done. Rarely do I pay for an app but this one won me over before my 14 day trial was up.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great way to limit phone usage for kids and a great way to track what they are doing.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Couldn't live without this app after i completed the trial. My son goes off & hides with his ipad. I can see he is on it from the app & shut the wifi off. Its the only way i can get him to do his homework,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Bugs and glitches (doesn't work and doesn't give the screen tasks at all sometimes)also i talked with customer service they couldn't help(because they didn't know what was wrong),1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app , really helped in agreed time on games/internet. Also very helpful in earning /loosing time for behaviour.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We battled with screen time limits with both of our sons but especially with our son who is on the spectrum.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great App that allows you to control your children's usage times on tablets etc, made a great difference in our household, can be disabled quickly via the parental app on on child's tablet if necessary, I would highly recommend it if you are having issues with usage time or even just certain apps that can be blocked separately..",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great application.   Help me keep the kids focus.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We parents are so happy with this app. I admit, I'm not always the best about physically monitoring kids' minutes on electronics, so Screentime does it for me! Keep up the great work. Children should be working with their parents to earn more screentime rather than complain on here...",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,No issues and the kids work for time. They want to do the dishes!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The service will confound younger children but anyone who has the presence of mind or luck to use widgets will be able to access apps that use widgets. This is because Screen Time can't draw over the home screen and widgets are displayed on the homescreen. Perhaps developing a dedicated launcher would be better if less reliable. The app is also quite process and service hungry. Force closing services - which are designed to restart each other - may have random success in bypassing Screen Time.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Finally an app that lets me control how and when my kids use their devices. Especially like the feature to pause it with a message when they are not doing what I say or coming when called. Also love it that they can download apps and then I am notified and get to approve their use from my phone.  This is the app parents have been waiting for.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is an easy way to have my daughter off when I want her off.  This app has saved us lots of arguments.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Keeps the kids from being on a phone all day when they should be doing home work or enjoying the things kids do outdoors. 9 hrs a day on YouTube is a little extreme.  it's has made my kids realize that there's more to life than electronics.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works well, takes the repeat reminders to turn it off away. Should have done this a while ago. Needs more Mac OS control on Apple's part",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My daughter doesnt like it....because it does its job. I can control her screen time effectively.  Worth every penny.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,These kids are only giving bad reviews because us parents can check everything.  I am an IT project manager and this app combined with teensafe is a life savor in monitoring everything on his phone.  Love love love,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My son hates it but I love being able to see what he is doing!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app with good features. I particularly liked the task setting - letting the kids earn extra time on their tablets by doing chores/ rewarding homework, but £42 a year - get stuffed!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I can't recommend this app enough.  My son is 6 and is very curious. This app is brilliant. We can see exactly what sites he has accessed and have all the appropriate locks in place.   At the touch of a button I can give my son extra time - he's currently asked for more time to email his Daddy who is away with work.  I have recommended this app to all my friends.  The web is a scary place - this app gives you the reassurance that your child can have the freedom to browse.  An excellent app - well done!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does not work with iphone. It has caused all sorts of problems with the phone. It will not delete off the phone.,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My 15yr old daughter just makes a widget for her messaging app & Facebook & any app she wants to use. Then she just looks at them through the widget on her home screen. Screentime cannot block the home screen (I asked them). So this app is pretty much pointless for me now. It dosnt even register that she's on her phone when she does it that way either. . .,2

She looks forward to using this app for the tasks that we've made so she is able to use her tablet time to be able to play the games and apps that we've allowed her to install.  It is a great little app to insure that she isn't able to ""veg"" all day on the tablet as well as insuring she is not able to start charging on my Amazon prime Account.  It is only getting 4 stars as it doesn't have a good web tracker / bocker",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app does exactly what it states by allowing to monitor and control your child's   activity on their mobile device.  The reason for three stars in my review is the dependability of the remote monitor function. I have found on multiple  occasions that the remote function is very inaccurate. What I mean by this is the remote app shows inaccurate usage and does not allow the block or activation remotely. I have contacted the developer and they keep telling me to refresh the remote connection. Not a solutio,3

But, I think that the creators of this app should add a place on the app where the child can text their parent if necessary.

It's totally worth the couple bucks that it costs EXCEPT--and this is a big except--there's now way to completely disable the guest account on our Samsung tablet. And the guest account has full access to YouTube, Chrome, and everything else you don't want curious boys having access to...  ADDED 7/2/16: Tech support is super amazing and helpful. They provided a workaround that should prevent access to the guest account. However, upon restarting the device--poof--the guest account reappears no matter what we do.",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app! I have six children some of them have multiple devices...the free apps only let you limit on one device whereas this app allows you to limit across all of one child's device and their ""free time"" is cumulative across devices...So if they have two tablets and a smart phone and you give them one hour of free time...they can't circumvent it by just switching devices and getting another hour like they can with the free apps.   Also, you can view their app log from your device and you can receive and approve their task approvals from anywhere...my kids send me a request through the app and I can remotely check that they've spent time doing educational apps first and then I can reward them with free time...kids hate it - I love it!  My only complaint would be that it's subscription based rather than paying once but at least they don't limit how many children a ""family"" is considered to be...in any case - I felt it was worth buying a year subscription after trying it for a month...",5

If my son is playing a game and then gets an ESPN alert and clicks on it to switch to the ESPN app but the game is still running in the background, and then he gets a phone call and is on the phone for ten minutes do the apps in the background still count against his time limit??",4

There are no questions about bed time or lights out, its all built in!  Thank you Screen Time!",5

Still, I might hane considered it, but I really resent the bait and switch approach.  First, they say it is free, always.  Then, they install premium edition without asking.  Then, the take it away, and only then you are allowed to realize that the free version is absolutely useless.  No functionality at all.  Sorry, guys.  I do not like being manipulated.",1

Make sure that your child does not have access to your phone and set a good password.  One quirk is on your phone you need two versions of the app (parent and child) and I forgot which is which.  I think it improves things with my son because it makes things simple, this is what will happen.",4

Set it and forget it. Easy to set-up and even easier to maintain. Love the  flexibility of what apps to block and when.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is a good concept that could be improved in many ways for usability and reliability. One example is a ""loophole"" we discovered where if you set the daily screen time limit for a child who has more than device on their profile, Screentime doesn't limit the time for the profile, it limits it per device. So, for example, if screen time limit is two hours and the child has two devices, they can watch two hours on one device and another two hours on the other device, totalling four hours. This should be fixed right away, and is only one example of usability issues.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We have 10 year-old triplets, and this app has been great.

Easy to use, I hope they continue to improve upon the great base of features.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Good little app, easy to navigate and user-friendly. I like that I can Pause the phone when my daughter is avoiding chores and such, and she likes that she gets a warning that her screen time is nearly up. Saves us arguing over her phone usage or her 'just a minute's that seem to extend into hours.  I've deducted one star due to my wish that the app had more complex features available, such as a per-app time cap or schedule. E.g. My daughter watches Youtube on weekend mornings. Rather than her spend her entire day's worth of limited app time on just this, I'd like to set limits on that one app for those days so she isn't just glued to that and complaining when her time runs out early.  I've deducted the other star, as my daughter has discovered that Hangouts is somehow exempt from the blocks if she already has it running. It is able to continue already ongoing calls and receive new ones regardless of whether her daily limit runs out, bedtime blocker is active, or I've sent a Pause.",3

I got her helping more around the house to earn extra time on her phone. For me personally I wish there where a setting to monitor who she's texting and about what. I've found this app meets about 85% of the security features I want. Again, this app dose what it says. By far the best one I've found and well worth the money for the piece of mind.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,No more complaining about chores if they know they can add 5 minutes to their technology time.  No more nagging reminders to brush their teeth and floss if they can add 5 more minutes.  I love that I can set a bedtime and a time they have to wait to get back on in the morning.  The only problem I've come across is 2 girls sharing the same tablet but the help chat said that's possible but according to Verizon just not on my tablet.   I don't have the ability to have more than one user on the tablet.,5

They would even sneak it at night and early in the mornings.

Totally worth the $4 a month!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works very well on my son's Android.  I highly recommend this to all parents.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app not only helps keep my son on task with his screen time it allows me to set tasks for him to do to reward him with more time on. Finally have him doing the chores he was refusing to do before and he has a better attitude about things.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The only thing I would like to see added or changed is to have the screen time blocked until a To-do list is completed.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app could be great if it also worked without WiFi. It works great at home, but when we're in a place that we can't connect to WiFi, the parental controls don't work at all. I really wish they could do something to fix this.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It works perfectly just what i have been looking for.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I really like this app it's even worth the money the free trial was great to try it the only changes I think it means is when you browse what their browser history is you should be able to click a site and block that site and Facebook messenger chat needs to be blocked and you need to be able to share the device between two kids even some kind of a password thing or something we have a tablet and two kids use it and they both have passwords and they have separate accounts but it still doesn't work,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great to check usage of apps. Duration of use is informative,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very Happy Parent#,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has been a life saver in my house.  After finding my 14 year old on his tablet until 4 am and failing all of his classes because he could not stay awake I decided to look for a way to crack down on the screen time in the home.  This ap has been a godsend.  If he wants more time he has to co.e ask me for it.....at least until he figures out how to write the code to bypass it which is inevitable.   I highly recomend this for every family.  Reading the 1 star comments from angry kids tell all.  Lolol,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app. Let's me set limits either by time of the day or amount of screen time. Also love that I can see when my child was last on her device.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app! Helps to keep the kids accountable. Only issue is signing as the second parent can be difficult.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I use this app to monitor, permit access and set limits to my children's android devices. As a parent I dont believe kids should be allowed to access everything online and this app is perfect for ensuring only the apps I allow will work. It's also especially handy to see what apps the kids have used, when and for how long. I would recommend this and the subscription price is very reasonable.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Nice tool full of features and really easy to set up. Regular updates. Our kids don't like it but understand it's necessary. As many other kids do they'd probably give this app a poor rating. Don't let bad reviews fool you and try it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app great to see what apps my kid is using and set time limits. Now that it's summer though I wish you could increase the bedtime settings past midnight for the occasional sleepover/reward but not have to turn off completely.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a great app!  Frustrating that Apple continues to not let u control down to the app level, but it has helped me monitor usage and access on devices. Kids may not like it, but it serves it's purpose well!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Screentime is awesome! Easy to use and gives the parent complete control over how much screentime the children can get. You can control what apps they use for added peace of mind. Would recommend it to ANY parent,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Had difficulty at first. It clashed with security I already had on the kids tablets. Online support was great and with some effort we got there in the end.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great reports of app usage. Interestingly, daughter is also now aware of how long she spends using different apps. Granular control of app usage. Just make sure that phone app is available so they can make urgent calls to you if that's what you want.",5

Will try the highly-rated Parenty Control app next that supposedly actually is free, not just for 14 days.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I really like this app. Before the free trial was up, I knew we were going to become subscribers. Totally worth it!   I love the fact that I don't have to get into verbal exchanges with the children every time I want them to put down their tablet. I don't have to track the daily time myself anymore - when their time for the day is up, the Screen Time app gives them a five-minute warning and shuts them down.   I have excluded all the book apps from the blocker, so after their daily limit is up, they can still use the tablet the way I originally intended, to read books.  Yet, I can set it to completely shut all apps down at ""bedtime"" so I know my son isn't up reading until midnight.  This app works perfectly for my family. My son has become accustomed to it after a month, but my daughter still hates it. But I can tell she is spending more time in free play, arts, crafts, and playing with her brother, so I'm ignoring her complaints.  I definitely recommend this app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love the app. My only wish is that there could be different daily limits and time starts. The customer service is awesome.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app makes keeping track of screen time super easy!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,this is what I've been looking form an app to eliminate fighting with my child over his devices and his screen time. Have recommended to many friends.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app.  Sometime it is slow but it does exactly what I need to keep an eye on my children while they are on their electronic devices. I like the control of setting up time limit and restricting apps.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Such a great app! I purchased the premium version after only a few days into the trial. There was no way I was going back to not being able to monitor their screen time. Love being able to see exactly what they've been up! I'm really impressed! I've set the daily limit fairly low and now the kids eagerly do tasks to increase the screen time. They also quite enjoy being able to send pictures if the completed task when requesting extra time. Customer service is excellent!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has really helped my kids (10 & 11) manage their time better. More importantly I can see what they are looking at (that was an eye opener!). You can pause their access and the 1 time I used it was amazing. I needed their attention and they were both giving me the ""almost done"" , ""just a minute"" for about the 4th time and I used the pause button. One asked, ""did you do something"" smiling....the other one came out of hiding and I had their attention at last! It is easy to add time as a reward.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent app - should be a default android app in this day and age!! Makes managing devices easy!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Get app. Easy to use. Nice features. Reliable. And it sends out wonderful  and useful alerts.  The low ratings are by kids trying to trash this app, because it works.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's a really good app, and gives you excellent control on your kids.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,One of the best features is my kid can't use any new app after install it unless I unblock it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Thank you for making this app. If you care about what your children could access on internet/YouTube etc, on purpose or by accident, if you are afraid of potential big mobile plan bills surprises, if you want to monitor the time they are spending on social media, or if you don't want your teenager becoming glued to tech all day long...then this app is to recommend to any parents who love their children. They will surely hate you for it, but they will get over it and thank you later to have really helped them gradually to be responsible internet users, as well as remaining connected to the real world around them . The great think about this app is that you can indeed lift gradually restrictions. If they hate it then it's the proof that it is working as advertised, this app is seriously fantastic and worth of few initial complains from your teenagers......;-)",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app! No more arguments and although the kids don't like it...it works!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does well,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very good app to monitor kids. Just add the feature of details of the app being used. Ex: if kid used YouTube app or site then it should show the name or details of the video kids watched.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Have used this app for a while and it is very useful. Functions smoothly, does what we need and keeps getting better. Thanks!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best control app out there!  You have the ability to be as lenient or strict as you wish. User friendly with many options you can change from your personal device. Highly recommended for those parents that care about what their kids are doing online.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best thing since sliced bread,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app!  It is an awesome tool to keep battles at bay and limit screen time.  Love it.  My kids just put their tablets away as soon as their time is up.  It isn't a battle anymore!  I love it.  It works well and keeps parents aware of their child's activities and promotes good,  healthy habits, teaches self control and balance. Thank you for such a great app!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Step son gives his mum lip I block his access, also stupid him from just sitting on his pad all day it means he's got to interact with his brothers.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Had limits everywhere then ran out of trial and it taught him to appreciate what he had. Now he has the ability to choose to make right choices but I can see if he does or not and he learns to not over due it and stay away from bad sites.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has helped me to get my child off the electronic and getting those small tasks completed.  Thank you for the creation, so glad I found this!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great and doesn't bog down mobile devices the way other monitoring apps I've tried do. It is also great for monitoring search history!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Helps the kids learn to earn time for the tablets. Helps me manage it remotely when i am not home.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"So far this app has worked great. I no longer have to fight a battle of when my kids need to put away devices. The apps they're timed on simply turn off. It's made really well, and kids don't really like it (that last bit was from my 9 year old).",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is an app you probably shouldn't spring cold on your tween or teen. It can be invasive and chilling even for the best of kids, and you need to have a good conversation about why you are using the app, what you hope to get out of it and be willing to honestly listen to your own child's response before continuing. Slapping into onto a phone and saying, ""Because I say so"" isn't good enough.  Chances are, if you've gotten to the point where you are arguing with your kids over this app, it's you who failed a long time ago to teach your kids limits.  That's where this app shines. I'm using it with my 9-year-old to help him model good behavior, be thoughtful about what he does and to have conversations about what he is doing, seeing and saying online.  As he grows and demonstrates good behavior, he'll be given the freedom to roam further, with less oversight, until we both agree he's at the point he can fly on his own safely and productively.   This is a great tool. Easy to use. Straightforward. Just enough options. But it should not be the the only arrow in your quiver, and you should not expect it to do your parenting for you.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have been telling everybody about this app. I am finally in control of the time my kids are on their tablets. There are no arguments and I am not the bad guy anymore.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app. I am able to adjust play time and see what my kids been doing and for how long!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is such an amazing app. I am able to control what my kids are doing without checking their phones and manage their time. Love it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Keeps my children safe from the crappy things that are on the internet. Gives them the freedom they still want but it gives me the control I need to help them stay safe.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I hope kids are not allowed to rate this app :) Has worked out great for us to control screen time for Android devices where we can have app-level controls. iPad control is a bit broader since iOS does not allow app level control. So, after the screen time is over for the day, our kids can still listen to stories via the Audible app on their Android devices. Not possible with iPad, though.  The best thing is when kids complain they didn't really use it for 1 hour -- just show them exactly what they did. Great for auditing their usage.  Great app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Your kids will hate it, you will love it as a parent. I only wish I could include the TV in the totals. Seriously, take control of the screen time before it gets COMPLETELY out of control. Easy to use and GREAT customer support.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Könnte mir nicht vorstellen wie ein Kind das umgehen kann. Einstellungsmöglichkeiten sind super. Auch die Aufgaben gefallen mir. Einzig wie ich ein geteiltes Limit für zwei Geräte einstellen kann (Tablet und Handy) hat sich mir noch nicht erschlossen.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has helped us manage our kids screen time so easily. I love that it can distinguish between the different apps they use. This allows us to let them have more time on Audible and limit the time on games and Netflix. I love, love, love the ability to pause everything when it's meal time. They magically come to dinner now, without having to chase them down. It's cut down on all the negotiating and requests for "" just 2 more minutes"".  Great app!!!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"So far, so good. Have had problems with my Autistic son running into inappropriate content on YouTube & now I am able to view exactly what he is searching & able to stop him via my phone if I like. Great app!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love the app it gives me information  that I need to know... to keep my daughter safe if I didn't have the app I would have not found out about somethings my daughter was questioning it sparked a good conversation...  she doesn't like the time restrictions  always  but it benefits her in the end and she always has the opportunity  gain more time by doing things a little different,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"...They're all from kids who are angry that this app works as advertised. So far I have no complaints as a parent, and aside from a couple of little feature requests (10 and 5 minute warnings for my son would make both our lives a little easier) I can recommend this program without hesitation. Your kids may or may not agree. :)",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love the detailed ability to change and fine tune what my daughter is able to do and that it updates immediately.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Tried a few, this is the best. Premium features are expensive, but work very well. The kids accept when time is up if the app tells them, whereas if we tell them it's more difficult. Rewards work well. Good information about apps installed and app usage. Love it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It lags on my phone when I try to help my kids with their tablets. IT JUST WONT WORK!!!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I wanted an app that would restrict the time my kids were spending on their gadgets, this app works perfectly, I don't find my daughter exhausted on the floor from her constant testing to her friends anymore.. Result. Even to the point of restrictions when she's at school but not so bad that it renders the phone useless. And the customer support I it's almost instant. But thumbs up",5

He knows I'm in control and yes he hates the app not me,  I paid for it and it functions pretty flawlessly.",5

Honestly  Then my free trial ended so I thought I would pay the minimal 3.99 for another month and see if I continued to find it as useful, wrong, for whatever reason the company they use doesn't like my card, was told my bank was stopping pmt.  Bank assures me everything on my end is fine.  No other options to pay, their solution, use another card.  I'll just use another service thankyou!",1

Pause all activity when needed, block certain apps, set daily limits of use, bed time setting where I can chose which apps they get access too and lights out when yes, lights are out. ;) The kids can earn extra time by doing chores so all of a sudden they are more helpful around the house. :) I also love that I am notified of every app they install and I can see what websites they visit etc. Great when you still have young kids (4, 7 and 10) and want to make sure they don't do anything inappropriate.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It was very easy to unstall and the tech guys helped me as we had a couple of kindles as well as android tablets. We've been using the app for a month and it has solved many tablet related arguments, especially around how long my children are on their devices.

Screentime even send me a message when they attempt it!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app that allows you to control your children's screen activity straight from your phone. Highly recommended if you need to set limits to your kids screen time.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app delivers what it says it will. And a sense of sanity in our screen obsessed world.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I can take back my kid's attention with simple touch of a key. I appreciate the way it tracks the amount of time in each app. The app helps with keeping them accountable for their time on their electronics. I also love the way my kid can earn extra time which provides positive reinforcement. At first I got eyeball rolling because I am limiting their access but they got over it. This app should be in every parent's toolkit.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app allows me to monitor my kids and what they do. Also allows me to regulate what they are doing on their devices and get their chores done by a simple message to pause their devices. Best app ever created to date.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Have recommended it to many other parents. Even my daughter after initial reaction admits it has been good for her. Be aware is it is always working in the background it does use up both your phone and your child's battery life.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Useful app but somewhat more limited if you use iOS devices. You can't control usage of individual 3rd party apps on iPhones.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best monitoring app,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app nails it!  I had been using Funamo, which is cheaper with a one-time purchase fee, but I have enjoyed the greater flexibility of this product.  Just perfect for Android phones!  Challenging boy is upgrading to an iPhone, which won't allow tracking of individual apps, so I can't speak yet for this for Apple.  However, it has been a godsend for an oppositional boy with droid phone.  I also found the tech support team to be very fast and responsive to my queries.  Worth the subscription.  Don't let the 1-star ratings from stymied frustrated kids fool you!",5

If their browser is compatible with the App, you can see exactly what they've been searching for for, and going to on the web.  This App is a must have for me!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Would give 5 stars if it worked as well on iOS as it does on Android.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Screen Time is one of the best parental control programs I've ever installed.  It, by far, has far less bugs than the others I've tried.  The fact that I can remotely control  what apps my kids use and how long they can use the device, that's very good and flexible.  It could be better if it also add usage break time feature which allows kids to use the device continuously for certain period of time and they have to take a break before they can use the device again.  This would make it perfect.  Currently, I don't have to keep an eye on my son as to how much time he can spend on his tablet.  That's priceless.  I save myself from lots of unnecessary repeated discussions with my kids.  That's priceless.  Also, the program gives me the option to allow unlimited use of certain programs such as google classroom and gmail.  Those programs are not games and they shouldn't be limited.  As you may have guess, the kids will not use those programs more than they have to anyway.   So far, I am very happy with this program.  They did a wonderful job.  For kids, they hate it because it works so well; for parents, they love it.  I would strongly recommend this program to all parents.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,You should know that this is the kid reviewing this app. Works!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome for setting boundaries and limits. A parent must!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Brilliant. Life changing.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great tool for controlling child access to Internet . Monitors and reports with minimum child friction.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"A really useful way to monitor your kids screen time, what they are using and reward them for good behaviour. Couldn't recommend more highly.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"After installing this program, I was terrified to see how much the kids were playing each day. At first we used a hard limit of 30minutes + some benefits. After a year, we relaxed the rules. Now both the kids and we just use it to have a overview and we are at a very reasonable weekly play-hours, and everybody is happy.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great on one of my boys that needed some controls on his tablet.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Our two boys now accept their tablet time-limit and move on to something else.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Finally something to control my kids' obsessions with tablets, without having to scream or holler or play detective looking for them as they hide so to play with their tabs. Interestingly, once they have used up their time, I get no complaints - they just go do something else, usually what they should have done earlier.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is perfect for helping me monitor my daughter's screen time. I LOVE all of the options it gives you. My favorite feature is the ability to assign and approve tasks that she can complete to earn more screen time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a dum app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app is very easy to set up and administer, and the reporting is really good. We allow most activity and have just let our kids know that we get a report every day of what they're doing.  Just knowing their activity is monitored helps them self-regulate. Best to set it up when you first give them a phone so they know what's expected from the start. But, worth the fight if that didn't happen. :)",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have this app installed on 2 kids phone. 1 is working 1 is not.  The 1 that is not working indeed blocked all apps during bed time, but when I turn off screen and reopen,  all apps lives again.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Nowhere in the description it says that the app is a subscription service and requires payment. It is ok to sell apps, but not ok to not mention it before getting superuser permissions from a couple of devices and downloading hell knows how much private information from them.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,But after 11 days you pay. It is a ok app but not easy to use.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This would be great but it doesn't work on my son's iPhone.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Would have given it 4 stars but slight glitch in the time. Doesnt report last used times in the correct time zone.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a well thought out app  and works great. Just what we needed. Thanks!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has brought peace to the house.  No more conversations about devices,  no more ""its only been five minutes.... I'm just going to finish this one thing.... Pleeeeeezzzz...."" Boundaries set,  no more discussion. Get this app.  I've recommended it to all my friends.  Their kids now hate me. They just have to combine multiple device time and it will be perfect.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This has allowed us to monitor the use of phones in a way that is responsible but fair. Woth Android devices, there are so many options. Easily worth the cost.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love the wide range of controls this gives me. A definite must for parents who want to stay on top of your kid's electronics,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It was a waist of memory and stinked 😒😒😒.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Probably the best parental control app out their for managing usage. Great support.  A little expensive if you think about the long term 10 years plus for me.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Why greenify is blocked And i cant unblock it?,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome app. It allows a lot of control over normally uncontrollable devices.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Does not work between daughter's  iPhone and my Samsung.  Paid, set it up, it emails me the daily update and always says that my daughter used her phone for 0 min.  Useless",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My son hates me for putting it he doesn't talk to me he never listens to me and won't ever look at me please get rid of it now.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Just what the doctor ordered. My kid hates it and I love it, because liniting my kids online time is good for her.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This has been a lifesaver!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Installed a month a ago. Quite practical application.  Easy to operate. 00% Recommend,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My kids no longer spend their spare time on their phones. No more late night phone snuggling. No more fighting.  I absolutely love it have already recommended it to a few of my friends.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app works great for both of my kids. I just wish there could be a grounded button to cut all access for a day or two with out having to reset all of the blockers.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Wow now I can't spend all day on phone,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Easy to monitor what my son does, limit his time, and allows him to earn extra time by doing tasks. Has helped with him being more responsible by doing tasks in the app. He didn't like it at first but has understood why we have it. Did the trial and then signed up fully",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Es una aplicación muy buena para controlar y regular el uso que hacen del móvil nuestros hijos. Es sencilla y fácil de usar y a mi me ha servido de mucho.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Does a good job. 10yr old son was within a few weeks able to circumvent  security and change settings, however with the help of support we reset the system. No problems since.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We have tried several different apps to have control over kids tablet usage and content.  Screentime is by far the easiest to use and most accurate.   We love that they can do tasks for more time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it keeps my 2 kids off there tablets all day and at night.  Kids don't like it but my wife and i do,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great way to limit the kids on device time, the task option is great! My children do not love it, but they are spending more time doing other things!!! 💕",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Kids hate how much control it gives me but I love it. Especially for summer. No being on electronics every hour all day long.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,If it's not 5* it's probably a child rating it who's not happy to have their device time limited! It's changed the way my daughter uses her tablet; now she's limited to 60 mins a day with the option to earn extra minutes by doing jobs...she's never been so industrious!  Works seamlessly on a variety of Samsung tablets and phones. Absolutely excellent and the premium version is worth every penny,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,worst app ever will take up a bunch of data and will only let my kid on settings after 10:00 i dont want him to be on the enternet but i still want him to be abled to play his games,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have been very pleased with this app. I wasn't sure how well it would be able to monitor/limit my kids' activity, but it has been great. My son figured out how to uninstall it the first day, but I followed the instructions from the website to prevent this. The kids weren't happy to be monitored, but agreed they would rather deal with it than lose their phones. Love the ability to motivate with tasks. I would like the ability to filter internet searches.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Doesn't load my child can easily delete it,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Kids constantly nag for more screen time but soon find something more constructive to do.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My daughter doesn't like it because it limits her use, but I love it!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has restored parental control over my 7 and 8 year old's tablet and phone use. The pause and play features are pure genius!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My son has been able to outsmart most of the other monitoring apps I've installed on his phone. But Screentime has proven unbreakable so far!! Thank you!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I am really enjoying this app! I am able to keep track and control how much time my pre-teens are online. I love that I can block social media apps, I am not ready for my kids to have access to them.  The daily emails are great.  It breaks down how much time my kids spend on each app! Keep up the good work!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Very personalized setting, quick modifications implemented simply",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. It has helped the children to manage/limit their own time and adds an extra layer of protection.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does what it says it does,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app takes so much of the worry out of appropriate screen time with my 7 year old grandson. I love the daily report email and naturally he would do anything to be rid if it... this only tells me he had plans for websites that he knew I would not approve of. thanks for the great , .easy to use app .",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Its dumb asf,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is great for parents with tablet/phone addicted kids, esp during the summer. I set the time limit, they know how much time they have and it's their responsibility to use it wisely. I created lots of tasks for them to earn extra time and it's been great motivation for them to complete chores without whining.  Since using the app I haven't had the ""just let me finish this game/video"" it's in their control to monitor their time.  It's also a great way to monitor what apps they use.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,makes life so much easier. my kids are eager and excited to do there chores.  i as a parent have more knowledge and am aware of how the kids spend there time. love it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Parents install this to stop their kids 'addiction' however when their time shuts off it leaves them wanting more time, causing an addiction, which the parents then exploit to get them to do jobs, after which they are given screen time, which cuts out and makes them MORE addicted.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great settings - can set limits per app per kid per day. No longer have to argue with my kids, they just got use to it and will not complain that iPad time is over.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have this app on my sons tablet, and although he comes of, there is a load of shouting. Very poor app for parents and kids. At 11 he is going to high school. He is skyping and then it turns off. It cause to much stress",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Once you limit the time available - kids soon prioritise what they do with their time and are only too willing to do a few chores to get a little more time especially on weekends.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's easy to use and does what it's supposed to do. Very good at helping parents protect their children and  ensure that too much time isn't spent on a tablet.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This has been a great app for helping us monitor how much screen time our kids have and what apps they spend their time on. It's our responsibility to teach our kids, but this helps a lot.  The daily limit helps so that they aren't on for too long. I would like to see the ability to set limits for specific apps and not just groups of apps. Perhaps I can and haven't figured out how. Also can I set bedtime and lights out on my own device?",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Family peace of mind. Screen time works fantastic!  Maturity within my teenager has changed over this past month. The difference is astounding. Thank you screen time...For parents that truly care about their children! Best App Ever!!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Absolutely loving this ap! We have control back over our 12yr old sons screen time! It has only been a couple of days but it has already made such a difference. Of course he's not happy at all but this app is exactly what we needed.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best app to take back control and limit your kids on their phone. No junior daddy doesn't hate you....he's teaching you that there is more to life then Facebook.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"While I would like to have unlimited time on my phone, this was a fair solution and is well-constructed. This is very simple and hard to cheat, but it doesn't make mistakes like other apps or ways to give kids 'time' do.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,But you must to talk with your child before and explain them that this is for they safety and health.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has been a great help in silently and consistently enforcing screen time limits - love it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"A very good app for android phone. I had problem limiting the phone usage on my son's phone.  Many times it lead to nagging n fighting. Ever since I started trying this app, it had reduces the nagging n fighting tremendously.. my boys are also aware that to earn more free time, they need to complete certain tasks. My very first time see my boys so enthusiastic to help with household chores n completing their homework.  Had recommended this to my friends and family members. Thumbs up!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app. Video games are addictive but I'm able to control my children's screen time, and they have more incentive to do chores or help out around the house. Way less stress for the parents and teaching the kids ""portion control"". I can give them more time on the learning games and less on the mindless ones.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have so much controll over my kids' devices. When we first started using it, my kids were really frustrated because I had so much ability to monitor and limit my their usage.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very useful!!!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best app i have used for controlling my children's cell phone use,5

I used to go crazy trying to keep my kids from spending too much time on their electronics and trying to make sure they weren't doing anything they shouldn't or viewing anything they shouldnt.  This app has given me control over those worries and given me a way to ensure those things won't happen.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is perfect for parents. I especially love the bedtime blocker, which gets my kids off of their devices at night. The bad reviews are from the kids who are upset that their parents installed the app on their devices. Too bad Screen Time can't come up with a way to block reviews of minors who have the children's version installed.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is great.  It is well worth the money.  It is well put together and very user friendly.  I get a daily report as to what the kids' did on their devises.  I can give extra time if there is need like a long car ride.  My 12 year old actually said he was glad we installed it.  You can set the daily limits, and it is up to the children to manage themselves.  It lets them  manage, but you retain ultimate control.  My wife and I have been very thankful for it.   There are some negative reviews on here, but most of them are vindictive youth that think they are entitled.  This has been great.  It is nice to have the devise manage  the time and report on it.  I was actually amazed that my kids used it less some days than I thought.  It eliminates parental unfounded suspicion and sneakiness from the children.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Ignore the 1 star reviews, most are from kids who hate this app because it gives control back to the parents. Best feature is being able to block use of the kids' devices in a few taps, ideal for getting them to come to the table or tidy up. Also, block device usage at certain times like night and/or school/homework time. Task lists that reward your child with extra screen-time for completing tasks. Blocking apps unless vetted by you. It's a digital Mary Poppins for digital times. Try the free trial.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app! A lifesaver with a child with Aspergers who would hide away with his headphones on in a world of his own all day! Allows you to gain control of gadget usage and monitor what they are doing! Plus encourage responsibility and rewarding tasks/chores! Well worth the subscription!,5

Hopefully other parents are as stupid as him. 😂😂😂😂😂  Then again hopefully your kids are not as smart as I am.  I'm a 4.0 student.  Who is able to manage her school work and screen time by herself thank you very much.  Don't use this app unless you really have to it could damage family relationships😂 not that those are important.",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So glad this app exist!  I finally have full control of the tablets even when I'm not at home.   My kids kept getting into youtube even after I deleted it. They were watching inappropriate content. I was ready to give their tablets away. I can block apps I don't want them to watch.  It's a fantastic app!  Worth every penny!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,All in one app and cheap,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,A system to 'earn' extra device time works really well. Good positive approach to the problem. New version also shows you real time what they are doing. Sending a 'pause' with a message gets them straight down to dinner!😃,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Of course my kid hates it, but since he thinks it is okay to be on his phone at school and after bed this is a great tool to help remove temptation",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best app for kid protection,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awsome,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has allowed me the freedom not to worry about how much time the children spend on their screens. I love it. They accept it. I'm happy. They cope. And now they do more reading,  more craft, more baking and spend more time doing other more useful stuff. It's a winner.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app, gives us just the control we wanted. Kids are safe and I'm check. Bizarre how they take the lock down when it's handed out by the screen time app but used to lose their toys out the pram when we would tell them to stop! Epic.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app, works as advertised. Worth every penny!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has been incredibly helpful in getting my kids away from their screens. It lets me set reasonable limits for their Netflix watching and then kicks them out once they've reached it. I hear them finally leaving their room and get the notification they've reached their limit seconds later - it's really entertaining! Love the configuration options and the fact that my husband and I can both change settings from our individual phones. Well worth the price for the pro version!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Quite simply, it does what it claims.  We regained control over the time the kids spend on machines, and stopped arguing about when the chores will get done and when to come to dinner. I think probably the strongest statement in favor of this app is the 1 star reviews from kids who cant evade the app... The more my kids complain the more convinced I am that this is an important part of teaching them priorities, responsibility and self control.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I don't usually leave reviews but this app is AMAZING! Literally monitors everything for you so you have no need to worry when your child is using their device. My daughter loves that she can complete tasks in order to increase her daily allowance. No more fussing over cleaning her bedroom or unpacking the dishwasher. If I could make any improvement, it would be to have the option to temporarily take time away from her daily allowance maybe for 1 or 2 days as a form of penalty for bad behaviour",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My 11 year old loves being on her tablet. As a work from home mother who also home schools.  Sometimes it's hard to stay on top of exactly how much time my daughter is on her tablet. This app has solved that problem for our family.  The biggest  benefit has been how many more chores, and extra home work she does now in order to earn additional minutes on her tablet.  I hardly even have to ask her to clean her room or water the plants, she takes the initiative to do it.  I love this app, I've told all my friends with kids they need it.  I truly can not recommend it enough.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Exactly what I needed for my son.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is perfect to control the time our 12 year old son spends on his phone. He seems to forget that it wasn't meant as a game machine or for video watching. We gave him a phone so we could get hold of him or he could contact us or his friends with a little bit of fun stuff too. We installed the app in December and just used it to get summaries of his use. We tried to let him police himself on the time spent but after getting the info about how long he spent watching videos lately we purchased the full version of the app and absolutely love it. He does not. Screen time is a great program with lots of features that i am hoping will keep developing and get even more options in the future.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We use it on all our kids devices and it works great, controls time, and keeps the kids focused on ""tasks"" aka house work...",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Allows me to control overall time spent on apps without blocking access to music and phone use. The best part of this program is the ability to select which apps i want included in the daytime limits, bedtime, and school time limits. I love that I can assign these limits to all devices used by each kid. When one kid loses privileges, I just change his access once and it applies to all devices I have registered to them.

Electronics have taken you (The child) and your time with us away! That's what's wrong today...no more family time! Don't get me wrong we the parents are just as bad about it too! That's the reason for this app! We have realized what's missing and are tired of electronics ruling our family's lives! Bottom line This app is downloaded and installed out of love!!

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great application.Looking for this kind of application since long .Happy to have highly recommend.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,As a working parent my monitoring etc only goes so far and constantly nagging about chores is tiring. This app allows me to make screen time a privilege that is earned. And the effect has been immediate including a change in attitude due to not spending endless time in front of a screen ignoring the world and homework being completed on time! Absolutely recommend this app for every tech savvy household.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We tried more expensive apps and find that this one does the trick for us. The kids get frustrated with it occasionally, but it allows us to use the phone time as incentive and get their attention when they have completely tuned out. It would be nice to be able to monitor exactly what they are doing online but they need to learn and understand a certain level of independence still.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Read the reviews!  The vast majority of low reviews are from disgruntled children.  Read through the reviews and you;ll see that kids hate this app.  This was helpful for me because if they hate it it means the app is doing its job.  So far I have found this app to do what it says it will do.  So far I am very happy with it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app!  Can you make screen time parental control also for windows?,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I was using the free trial version for a while, but then they added the option to control Apple devices, which gave me the incentive to upgrade to the paid version!  I calculated as follows: if you give me one cent for every time I have to nag my kids about their devices, that's 10 cents a day, times 365 - comes out to about the annual price of $40. And it's worth to me much more than 1c per nag, actually! I think the kids actually feel liberated too by having this impersonal program that they can't argue with. They plan their day around the restrictions and are much happier, with more time on their hands for non-screentime pursuits.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"When first installed, there was a bit of protest from the kids, 11 and 13, but now it is accepted as part of the deal. I will put 5 stars when the time allowed is per kids and not per device, improvement which im told is in the pipeline. Support has been very good and very reactive.

I absolutely love this app. It has caused grades and chore performance to go up. Every parent that has kids with smart phones needs this app. I sell Cricket wireless and every time I set up a family plan I show the parents this app. I could only love it more if it would allow me to make individual numbers time sensitive also.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Have been asked to rate this app due to angry kids leaving negative feedback. It is a known fact that too much times on devices is detrimental to children's development. I love the tasks as this gives them incentive to get there jobs done. When I had problems with the app the support staff were patient and helpful. Awesome app,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very Helpful,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app. It needs a little work regarding the addition and expansion of features but gets the job done! Most of the 1 Star reviews are kids who are mad that they can't get their way anymore or parents upset that it moved to a pay app after getting it for free for over a year.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,If you want your kids life back from these horrible devices then don't look anywhere. I never rated any app in the past and it's my first ever comments on Google play.

Rather than moan asking for time they accept their tablets won't work after a certain time or after their time runs out. We give them bonus time when they have been good. I can 'kill' their tablets from my phone too!,4

I'm VERY glad I listened to them and made the switch.   First, I've had a number of questions and some feature enhancement requests that I've made through my account on the screetime website by clicking ""Contact Us"". They have been VERY responsive to my requests, and have answered my questions thoroughly, and have thanked me for my suggestions that they said they would take to their development team. I never received responses like this from Mobile Fence.  Second, with 6 kids of varying ages, our family has a wide diversity of device make and models ranging from Android (KitKat to Marshmellow), Iphone, and Amazon Fire devices. Mobile Fence only installed and worked on newer Android devices. I've installed Screen Time across 8 different devices, and it has worked flawlessly on each one.  Finally, I like the task reward system Screen Time has. I also like how we can manage and see usage and settings across all of our kids devices in one place, under one app, or under one web page.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app really helped to control tablet time in our family. Kids are looking for chores to gain a few more minutes! Good work,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I hate this app but that's because it's doing is job. The only thing I would change it make an option to whitelist something like texting. You also might want to a feature that will warn you when you are about to get kicked off. It's really annoying to be in the middle of something and get kicked off. It would also be nice to have an option when the app blocks you to have a ""request permission"" option. However it is  a good app not too expensive. I would definitely recommend.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Has been a life saver for our family.  Very easy to set up and figure out.  I love that he can earn time by doing chores. We were having problems with our son waking in the middle of the night to play on his phone.  This wonderful app has stopped that cold!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Newly downloaded apps don't show up right away in my parent app. I have to go onto my child's device to unblock it. Other than that, the app is very easy to navigate. I wish the message that comes on the screen if the child is running put of time, in an app they aren't suppose to or so forth were easier for the kids to understand. Perhaps a simple word with a picture for younger kids who can't read.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Used to have all the basic features required for free, now moved to subscription and all the basic features such as ability to restrict time in particular apps is only available if you pay.

Continues to work on other sons tablet but will be looking for alternative software for both devices now.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My son can stay all day in his room on tablet. This app is great for time management. I set limits and he can check and see how long he still has and picks up chores for additional time. The pause and play options come in very handy too!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love it. Both my kids behaviour have changed. I love the fact you can turn all apps off remotely too.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,A lot of good options to make sure your child does not spend his entire life in the phone.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very useful to monitor kid's online activities and to enforce bedtime.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Terrific App.  Would like to see a few more features but overall, it does what it claims to do.  My kids don't like it which tells me it really works.  It limits their screen time when they should not be on the screen and allows me to open the app's on their phone for any amount of minutes I want to like 5 minutes up to hours which I use for good behavior, etc.  By the way, note the huge amount of 1 and 2 star reviews and lower number of 3 and 4 star reviews then tons of  five star.  Those 1 and 2 star ratings are mostly from kids who HATE this app which means it works..it does what it is suppose to do.  Try the free trial for two weeks and you'll see.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We were having trouble with our kids sneaking time and content on their devices and this app allowed us to set boundaries on time and applications remotely and easily.  It is very flexible, does exactly what it claims with no glitches, has excellent customer support and even has bonus features allowing extra time or complete remote shut down. Now that we are back in control as parents, there is much less arguing about 'screen time'. Our teen still hates it but knows that the boundaries are firm.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have used the trial app and now us the paid version.  Very good and does what it says it will.  My son hates it...which means it's doing its job!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"i think its a great app my kids are 3 and 4 and when screen goes blue, they know its bedtime and tablet needs charging for tomorrow.  plus like the flexibility it gives with times and apps you use i would rate it 10 out of 10.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I use the free version.  Works well for monitoring kids time on their device from your device.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great App...,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Stable and suppoted well. More of a remote/time/filter/reward tool, than a draconian surveillance tool. Little bit tricky to set up. Talk with kids before installing & start with low daily limit to encourage rewards. Browser log not currently working on lollipop os. Wish it worked on older phones & android/appleTV as kids use them. Wish someone made a dns tool that filtered based upon room location: bluetooth strength? I have tried every parental tool avaliable, this is the best one and worth every penny!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My son hates this app, and I love it. Gives the control back to us and makes it so easy to control and monitor his tablet usage. Also love the added benefit of being able to add or subtract time for good or poor behaviour. Brilliant.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Fantastic App!!!!  This has been fabulous having just given our 10 and 12 year old girls a tablet each.  We have always had reservations about the amount of time kids spend on their 'devices' and Screen Time has made it all so simple.  Thanks so much!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I actually enjoy this application.  However,  I would recommend changing something so that it update on the kids phone right then. It takes to long for restrictions or unlocking to update on youths device.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,works well. less fighting with my kids over screen time. controls all the programs and very easy to change settings.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We are very happy with this app and the ability we now have to monitor our daughter's phone usage. This app is easy to use and the information is easy to access.  We highly recommend it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I'm a parent. ..and this is the best app thus far. To sumit up...allowing a parent to be a parent and a kid to remain a kid.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I'm able to let my kids access only the apps I feel are appropriate for their ages. The bedtime blocker & lights out functions give me the assurance that my kids aren't up all hours of the night instead of sleeping to get the rest they need for school the next day.  My only suggestion for improvement is to allow the bedtime & lights out to be different on weekends. Also, Friday to be set as part of the ""weekend"" setting for allowed time would be nice.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Been using this for a while, recommended to all my mom friends,  was a great app, now you need to upgrade and pay for blocking apps and time management when it use to be free. Boo! on you!!",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Anyone wishing to act as a responsible parent should have this app. One of  a kind. I have this on my nephew's device *and* on his mother's, since he'll just switch devices at bedtime otherwise. I can disable youtube, games, etc. on school nights and leave her phone's other functions intact, and she has no complaints, as she doesn't use these features anyway.  ***One feature request would be to have specific time restrictions on each day, rather than having to switch times every Friday and Sunday.*** -1 star for that, since it is a paid app.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app.  If it wasn't for Screen time I would not have known my child was looking at inappropriate YouTube vids and Google search.  Now we have more family time and he has taken up his art talent again. Maybe I should install this app on my husband iPad,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My son is addicted to games and electronics.  This is so helpful. I bought the 6 month service right away.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I am really thinking to upgrade,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has made limiting screen time soooo much easier with our 5 year old.  I especially like the feature where he can earn a little more time by doing some chores and you have full control to edit those chores/items.  Glad I found this app when we were struggling with device addiction of sorts, it has been a lifesaver.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a parent, I love how effectively it works!  And frankly, screen time app has protected my son from seeing porn pop ups and avoided him from clicking on them to see what it's all about!  The email updates tell me extacly what he's doing on the tab and I can adjust the settings as needed.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I and my husband think this is great, my kids and especially our 12 year old son does not! We had used another monitoring app but he'd managed to do. Something with his tablet to override it and we discovered he was using at various times in the night when he should have been asleep. He's not been able to bypass screentime so we're really happy! (and it has a better monitoring of what he is doing)",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've tried other screen locking type apps that made the whole family scratch their heads trying to make it work or figure how it works.  Screen Time Parental Control makes limiting easy and the settings are easy to understand and set.  I've heard a lot of people say; ""well they force you to pay to get premium so you can set everything"".  Wouldn't you pay to keep your kids away from inappropriate content?  Save their minds for being great?  Have happy, well balanced lives with exercise?  I bet you would!  Screen Time Parental Control allows all the control a parent would want!  Well built and worth the upgrade to premium!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app. I can control how long my kids are on their devices. It's also got a pause feature so if I need them to do something and they "" can't hear me"", I can press pause for however long I wish. My kids hate this app though lol",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Really happy with this app. I have two girls under 10 with smartphones and their usage was getting out of hand. Screentime allowed me to introduce manageable limits to their usage, with great flexibility in terms of how I did this. While the kids weren't happy to see these controls come in, it allowed us to properly discuss why it was really in their best interests.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Just look at the reviews by the kids. They hate it. I can limit my kids time and reward them with this app. They've learned to accept it and no longer complain. It's this or no phone/tablet. I wish there was a Mac/pc/Xbox/ps3 version. I'd use them all.,5

If we have a road trip I can increase the time, if he is grounded I can cancel his time so he can not sneak away.  I do not buy apps.  This is the only one I ever felt was worth it.  It has helped my son to learn to manage his time and it has also brought books back into his life.  Thank you screen time labs. You have made a difficult part of parenting easier!!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app giving me back control over my kids habits on their tablets and phones. It works very well without glitches. I love it so much I have paid for the premium version.  Worth every penny,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love it, my kids DO NOT!  Which should tell parents it's a good thing!   You have to make sure they don't have access to your phone because they can change and delete things if they do.  It saves a lot of arguing and frustration at our house and it gives them a good idea of how long they actually spend on electronics if left on their own.  It's like the Lotus lounge - they honestly think it's been 20 minutes when in fact it's been 1.5 hours!  I did have trouble with one child's phone - the app just wasn't keeping track, but I deleted it and reinstalled and it seems fine.  Worth the nominal monthly fees so I can be a parent instead of constant electronics monitor.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Amazing app! Totally worth the $3-4/mo, I recommend it to every tech savvy parent! I'm so tired of my kids being sneaky and finding ways to play their video games when they don't have permission and are supposed to be doing other things. We're replacing all gaming devices with tablets, and now they can play educational games....while I have full control of the time they spend and can revoke it even remotely if they have hidden their device and claimed to have ""lost"" it then spend an hour in the bathroom.... Warning: Kids can hack the app to remove or dismantle it, so be sure to BLOCK their access to the phone/device settings. Since some kids can read (and even write) reviews here I'm not going to detail how its possible. I have noticed a glitch on occasion, blocking or unblocking an app will sometimes create a short period where it is accessible. But it is usually rectified within a minute or so when it kicks in. It might have something to do with the ""temporarily unblock"" feature? Idk, it hasn't been an issue for us.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app. My girls were constantly on their phones and tablets. This helped me limit their use especially at night, during dinner, when grades weren't where they should be or for punishment.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have so much control over what my children see and do on the internet now. The thought of my children being online used to scare me and now because of this app i can sleep at night. Highly recommend the paid subscription.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app! It easily supports me in teaching my children to limit their screen time as well as allowing instant rewards for doing tasks. My son happily does his daily chores and then asks for more because he knows he will get 5 minutes extra! Worth the subscription 😁👍,5

I would be happy if my kids could ""hack"" your application when they grok the idea of distributed systems.",4

The other day, the elder came to me and said: we tidied up our room, can we get some more time? They had discovered the sample tasks.

Better granularity of control when it comes to both apps and timing make this more flexible and easier to use.

Thank you for offering this to parents, I feel like I have no control at times of how long my kid is on his phone. The bed time option is great. And the ability to approve or not approve more time is great for then to earn. Also you can pick and chose apps to block. I like it",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Strikes a good balance between functionality and simplicity. Thoughtful features like pause and play for out of plan usage changes are greatly appreciated. My only gripe is minor: UX around the clocks could be improved including allowing typing in numbers... Good stuff.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The reason so many kids give this app 1 star is because it works! Using 1 yr+ - very impressed with development, features such as Companion App (stops kids from disabling ~ may need extra steps to prevent really shrewd ones from circumventing). Remote Monitoring lets us guide kiddos to smart choices with device time. Premium subscription allows school/bed time restrictions. Now everyone knows what to expect so very calm, peaceful solution. I even use it to restrict *my* bedtime. Many thanks to dev team.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is awesome. Well worth every penny. My 10yr old got her first cell phone for her birthday as she spends time between my home and her mom's and needed consistent communication to me.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Takes a little while to get it set up and to get your kids trained.  App needs some work on preserving core functionality while in school mode.  But I think they are on the right path. I went from the trial to a paid monthly membership because it is worth it.  Would be nice if they had a desktop pc version.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We had the trial version for a month, then tried a few months with out it.  The kids did okay, but we needed the tasks to help us out. I upgraded and put this app put on all my kids tablets.  Why?  Because as a parent I am responsible for all they do.  And a KID with a TAB:ET, should be held responsible for everything they do on the tablet.   That is too much responsibility for them with out Screen Time.  My kids have learned time management skills and accountability through this app.  They want more time?  Adding Tasks (chores) helps with this.  They simply take a picture of  their chore as proof, email it to me at work and I approve their time.  so simple and easy.  It is pretty easy to lock down certain pre-installed apps as well, like YouTube.  But still allows them to use the calculator and their downloaded books. I love this app, my kids respect it because I took the opportunity to teach them why they needed it, rather than use it as a discipline tool.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I recommend this app, it worth it,  it provides balance to your family life since sometimes kids want to over use their electronics. My daughter doesn't like it, but she understands that its for her own good, so she decided to make the best of it by going outside to drive her bike, trampoline and go to the park with sibling. She usually gets 1 hr daily since she still attending school, and 2 hrs in the weekend. My daughter appreciates the above and she admits that sometimes she uses the tablet too much. :)",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is worth its weight in gold, as  far as I'm concerned! My son's not a fan, of course, but that's expected. It's made it so easy to control his screen time, see what he's been up to, and even reward him with extra minutes when he completes a task. It takes the argument out of the picture and let's the app be the ""bad guy"". Now there's no more negotiating over time (and meltdowns), because there are clear guidelines and limits. I also love the updates, so I can monitor what he's up to.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I really like this app, however... today, I told my son that using the browser for his homework doesn't count on daily limit. I turned the app off from the daily limit while he's doing his homework. When he finished, I turn the app back on, only to realize that when I turned it on, it took the time away from his limit. Now I can't turn it back on until tomorrow. Maybe he won't realize he has free reign of the browser all evening while I'm at work. ;-) Just a suggestion. It would be a nice capability.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My husband and I figured $40/year for all of our kids was worth it. Easy enough to use. I love hearing their exhaustive ""ughs"" from the other room when I pause their phones or when they use up their time limits. My more brazen child is hard at work figuring out how to bypass the controls, and I have no doubt she will figure it out, but she agrees it is better having some limitations than no phone at all.

Nothing, they're lost in their tablets.A wait a couple, hit pause in the app and as if by magic, all three disengage from their tablets.No fighting, no one upset and they're ready to move on to the next thing.Many features make this app great.",5

Now my daughter looks forward to complete task because of the rewards. Great job!!,5

Just set the app up and then it gets to tell them when they're done, it also helps them with learning to budget time.  If you don't use this app I would dare to say that you are not being a good parent. Do you really know how much time they are spending on there devices and what they are playing or looking at?  The full version is well worth the money and should be a must if you allow your kids time on tablets or phones.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a picky dadministrator, I had a hard time looking for a tool that would encourage healthy mobile habits.  My kids were the toxic type walking around the store with their phones in front of them vocalizing everything they were doing.  It was annoying and embarrassing.  This is not a replacement for parenting but rather, a supplemental tool. This app allows you to set time limits, block certain apps on school days, and set curfews.  It should NOT be used as a kill switch, because then kids learn nothing.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I NEVER pay for apps, so for me to pay for an entire year up front means a lot. My son (7) was face deep in his tablet, every free moment he had. I tried a bunch of different ways to try to keep track of the time he spent on it, but he got sneakier. Now that I have screen time, he is very aware that there is a limit, and is much more aware of the time he spends on it. I also feel much more comfortable now that I know everything he does on it. I have highly recommended this to all my friends with kids!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great way to track your Child's usage and to shut it down if they use too much.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I can give chores or 'random acts of kindness' to my kids to motivate them for more screen time. Or shut it off if they're not responding for dinner!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Exactly what I need...,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app to allow frank conversations about appropriate screen usage followed by clear guidelines that are controlled by a clock and not emotions.  My son and I have been able to discuss the research about sleep and screens and decide on an appropriate ""bedtime"" for his device.  He doesn't love it, but now he and all his friends know when the texting stops.  I am also able to block all new apps until we talk about them and decide if they're appropriate for him. Wonderful app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Installed this app a month ago,  just using the free version to get an understanding on how much screen time my oldest was getting and what apps she was using.   It was great information.   Yesterday I used that information when I signed up for premium.   I set a fairly low limit and gave her some chores to do to earn more time.  She spent more time with her sisters yesterday.  She did the chores without complaining and then got time on her phone and the app helped her get to bed on time!!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app for monitoring what apps children use, and time spent on Internet.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Brilliant easy to use software. Keeps kids off devices when they're supposed to be in bed asleep so no more of them sneaking on at silly o'clock. They get more time for doing tasks,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I HATE THIS APP!!!! I updated this app 8 times in the past 13 minutes! WHY?!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Not having to monitor my daughter's screentime 24/7 is amazing!!!!!  Love this app and fully recommend it to every parent! !!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a sick excuse for an app. It's absolutely horrible and a risk to our well being and dignity. I will go choose another app or make my own.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This has given me so much peace of mind and has helped me follow through with my limiting screen time.  I had a hard time remembering just how long my son had been on any devices and with the tasks has given us a win-win situation.  Thank you!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Needed an app to control how my kid spend his time on a couple of devices he/we have. This is the app to do it, look nowhere else. Don't believe most of the 1 star ratings, these mostly kids who are unhappy because they're now in check on what they can and cannot do on their devices. The app is granular enough to block whatever is needed to block ,and to leave some other apps open as needed. In general, great app...",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Grateful for a good, well designed app that allows us to manage our family's personal media use in such specific ways. Thank you.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My son would hide his phone under his pillow and use it when it was his bed time i work grave yard so i cant always check up on him with this app i can monitor him and block him from using the app during certain times plus i can pick which apps to block because he likes to listen to music when he goes to bed so i leave that one unblocked they need to make something like this for gaming systems,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My 8 year old isn't thrilled but this way we can limit her time and like that multiply people can do even our nanny can pause her time. Gives more info that is a little over board but my husband and I differ on this as he thinks we need to give privacy. I like knowing or at least being able to go look if something seems up.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The more bad ratings from kids the better. It means the app is working well.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It straight up horrible,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My kids hatebit cuz it makes them do other things besides playing games on electronics thanks for this app,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My kids hate that I have Screen Time installed on their tablets and that I can see how they spend their time. That should tell you that it's a great app and does its job flawlessly. :-),5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have tried quite a few apps with disappointing results and with 3 boys that all have their own tablet, this is a great app to help control their usage!  I love all the features and the ability to control the settings from my own device remotely!  From work I can send them extra time or block things I am notified about.  I can get emails with details of every download and see what apps they've spent every minute of their allotted time on.  I won't be searching anymore - I've found one that works!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app extremely easy to use and it has worked well with our kids....they have even started doing jobs around the house!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Disappointed at how it works with iOS but that's not Screen Time's fault. Thank you.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app to help parents limit kids screen time and be able to see what their kids are doing.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This has made our lives so much easier as our kid was constantly on his phone late at night and before school. He still gets to use what he wants during the times he is allowed to use his phone, but we can control when he comes off. Thank you so much Steve for making our parenting journey easier, we don't mind paying for this app at all :)",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it! I now have complete control over my 10yr old daughters phone and can restrict the amount of time she's on it everyday plus the added security of knowing what she's spending that time doing.  (UPDATE) loved the app until it was time to purchase. I tried purchasing a full year subscription. Put the money on a prepaid MasterCard and low and behold they wouldn't accept payment due to the transaction being considered international. Very disappointing.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Stupid app and  im an adult,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app to limit time on devices.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Puedo controlar fácilmente el tiempo de uso de la tablet de mi hija. Puedo darle bloquear y darle acceso a ciertas aplicaciones durante el tiempo de escuela incluso monitorear las aplicaciones que descarga.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works as advertised. Helped my kids have a more balanced use of the devices and had them play other activities.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Perfect! I love it! This is the best parental control app ever! I tried it for free several days then decided to buy subscription for year. The app works wonderful! I can control my children while they are playing at their phones and tablets; I need only open the web page of Screen Time at my computer and at once I can change settings, time, or block apps while kids are occupied with their games, I do that if they do not listen to me! Also, I like timer, bed and school time block options, I can set up time for kids when they need to work and when they can play! I believe every phone/tablet have to have this app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The perfect app to control time spent on games by kids who should be outside getting exercise and sun! Those giving this app a less than excellent rating must be the ones being limited by their parents ; ) have not had a single issue, and I have this on multiple devices.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has definitely improved life in my house. My son knows exactly how much time he can spend reading on his tablet each day and when it shuts off for bedtime. No more arguments and tons of offers to help out around the house to earn a few extra minutes in the evening. It also simplifies the process of monitoring kids' browsing habits.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,As a parent... this is what you want!!!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app which we have been using in our house for the last few months.  My son initially was annoyed we'd installed it on his device but now he has got used to it and will do chores to earn extra time!  We also have a laugh with it as I send him messages to pause his time like...""come and make your Mum laugh!"".  I love that I don't have to clock watch and know he has a set time set up and that I get a message every time he downloads a new app.  I also think the fact I can control his access from my phone is great.  Have already recommended to lots of friends.  Also the online support is great if you have a problem with fast response time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Living with my mil and needed to regulate how often she was letting my daughter play on her tablet so I installed this app! Absolutely love the features. I can block what sites I  don't want her on and leave other educational apps open!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is exactly what I was looking for! My 15 year old daughter was upset at first, but now she understands. The reality is that if she wants to have a phone and we're paying for it, we need full access to it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app sucks. There are many problems with it. 1. The updates. It pulls up a notification, and reminds you every 2 minutes. This is very annoying when you are doing something else, like a game. 2. It often messes up. Once I had 30 minutes, but 5 minutes later,  I was out of time. 3. It some times gets all glitch, and you have to restart your phone. 4. You can Turn on safe mode, download a game, get back on normal mode, and play that game without a limit.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Screentime has been easy to use and provides just the level of control and monitoring we needed. You can remove the time limits on select apps like the Bible and Pandora while setting a daily limit on specific games. You can set more time for the weekend too.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The single best app purchase I've ever made.  Parents will love it, and kids will initially hate it (that's the point).   It's restored sanity in our house and changed the screen-addicted zombies back into actual people.   They used to fight about games and groan about having to put the phone down for 10 minutes to eat dinner.  Now, they fight each other to do chores so they can earn a few extra minutes.   Technically, the app delivers on everything it claims.  It's simple to install, easy to configure and works exactly as expected.   There are a few things I'd love to see added, but there is an active community on the developer's site and they seem to listen to customer suggestions.  The free trial period is fully functional, which is nice.  I quickly purchased a one year plan and it's worth every single penny!  Do yourself a favor if you're on the fence and install this today.  On the down side, as great as it is on Android, it's terrible on IOS.  That's not the developer's fault, it's the result of the way Apple controls app access.   Still, all of the granular settings disappear and it becomes all or nothing.   For me, having the phone and text features disabled are a no-go.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Was a brilliant app until the trial ran out now unless you pay horrendous amounts A MONTH and NOT a one off fee it's useless ALL features are premium.... uninstalled,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love to see web history of my kids that I can quickly link to. I like how quick I can turn on and off apps. I also love the reward aspect that my children can earn time. Well done.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has provided such a peace of mind as a parent.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app works well.  It is a great discussion starter everyday on media time.  It did take a few setup changes to get apps that he needed to be available after time is up.  Great flexibility.  I like the summary emails daily.  My son hates this app but it is an effective time counter and control for the phone.  I am paying the monthly fee so I can turn use the time limit daily.  Seems worth it.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love it! I am in complete control. My son is complaint so you know it works.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this App.  It lets me set daily time limits, but can be scheduled to have it turn off apps by 9:30pm and then phone shut off right at 10:00pm!!  It send you daily usage charts through email, and it allows the kids to request more screen time through chores and acts of kindness.  I highly recommend this app.  We are using Androids and Screen Time works great. I am getting ready to set up the iPad, so we will see how that goes, Apple is tricky.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Kids accepted this right away. No more arguments to get off. Kids do all their chores now. My only beef is the cost.  3 kids. I feel a price of 1 dollar a month is fair. Can only hope a competing app arrives to drive down the cost.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Well, in my opinion. My dad put it on my Hudl and it RUINED my life - it felt! I'm 10 yet I feel like a baby. Being bossed around by an app. My parents love it though.",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I really like this app it has been very useful in our home!  With four kids it can get crazy at times trying to keep track of everything and it  makes me feel a lot safer to have it and helps them be more accountable.  We recently had one of our kids phones stolen and it was amazing to be able to shut down any access to it. I would love for there to be a location side of the app ( which I've been told is in the works) and possibly be able to see the content of texts but other than that I really enjoy it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great. Great. Great. For android. Not so great for ipad. Love the stopping of arguments.,4

We chose this ap due to a friend at work had purchased it and had heard me telling of my issues with my kids and their smart phones. The ap is quite comprehensive and the sum up, we purchased the ap... I recommend it as much as possible.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app, my kids (8 & 6) just don't question it. When they've had their hour daily limit it just turns off so I don't need  to be on their back all the time asking them to put it down. But I can alter all of the settings as I see fit, so when my daughter was poorly she could have extra time etc. Would highly recommend it for younger kids.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Both parents can have app on devices and info can be shared.   Whether tasks were completed is top issue we got around.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Nice App!!! If it had geolocation it would deserve 5 stars!!!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is the app to have! It is a win-win. Kids aren't constantly on their phones AND you don't have to worry about them doing bad things or having their lives revolve around the phone. They can focus on SCHOOL!!Now to the BRATS! :) I get where you come from, I'm 23 & raising my 2 brother's  (11 & 13), it is so hard to juggle parenting, and just life in general w/o having to worry about what they do on the phone. This app is not bad!! You want more mins? Do some chores & earn it!! Learn some responsibility.",5

I have one limit for weekdays and a different limit for weekends. I include the gaming apps and internet in the blocked apps, but I leave the camera open all the time so he can use his tablet to take pictures. I added certain tasks, such as cleaning his room, that give him bonus time on the device. I'm so thankful for it!!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is amazing. My kids would sit on their tablets all day if they could. The stress has gone down in the house since installing the app. We no longer have to constantly tell the kids to get off their tablets. They also come do things the first time we ask in order to avoid the dreaded pause message. One of my kiddos decided to uninstall it. I got the notification and kindly informed her that she could either leave the app alone or I'd sell her tablet. No more issues.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is the app I have been looking for since I introduced my kids to screens of all kinds. Removing screen time is the only form of 'discipline' that has any currency with them. So much so that when they do have access they are careful to use it wisely.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"If your child want to be responsible and have a handset then parents need to be able to trust them.  So kids if you're reading this, it because your parents can trust you with your handsets and want to keep you safe.

However the email asking for a review because kids are putting up bad reviews is a little underhanded. Especially when I scroll through and 90% of comments are positive.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Guess I missed the notification that the trial period ran out. Noticed when my boy had the tablet in his hands for too many hours the other day. I'll look at a paid subscription now.  Updated 3.28.16 Using ST on two devices. Generally works well and provides good control of my son's device (s). Wish I could sync both devices as one so time limits were aggregated instead of each device being time limited individually.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great way to limit kids screen time without having to hound them daily. It makes the apps vanish at night when they should be sleeping.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has been so simple to use and perfect for our family.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I absolutely love this app. I have complete control over my son's phone, even when I'm not at home. I love that I get notifications as well for what he does, apps he downloads. Fully aware at all times what he's doing. I love it!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app! Your kids won't like it but they'll get use to it.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a father of 3 boys, this app is what I have been dreaming of.  Well done.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My 10 year old thinks he's a hacker. Riiiight. OK. This app has helped us help him control his behavior. Bad behavior = no screen time. Now, in all honesty, he did figure out a way around this on the tablet, but he's been threatened with having the tablet confiscated permanently if he does it again. He hates this. In addition to this, we are using Microsoft Parental Controls on his computer. My, what a change in behavior we've seen lately! Love this app. Parenting win!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've attempted to use the app, however, as stated by other parents it's too easy for the children to manipulate. It does have a lot of potential and is an excellent idea but needs more work tbh",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Simple to install, simple to use, and effective for my two boys (ages 5 and 7). Yes, you really need to purchase the subscription, but it's a bargain for the variety of features and the decrease in struggle getting the tablets turned off. I saw several other apps in this category but Screen Time immediately stuck out as the most professionally designed option. Thanks for helping cut the chaos in our household!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app really does help to manage the kid and his phone. Lots of options and very flexible.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I really like this app. It makes it easy to keep track of what my son is doing on his phone. He doesn't like it, but what's the alternative? I don't want my child to be a statistic. I suggest this app to all who care about their kids.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Nanana teenagers...this works great.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My 12-year old son despises the app but I love it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a great app!  Kids weren't big fans in the beginning, but after a few weeks, we have their attention back and school grades are improving.  You have total control of your kids device and usage.  Highly recommended!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We use it for both our children on their Android phones. Before using Screen Time, we regretted giving the kids smart phones (as they used them for games and videos rather than actual, you know...phones).  Now, we have them locked down tightly and it's been good to use the  ""Play"" time function to send free time to reward the kids for good deeds.  The ability to apply different usage limitations for each child, their bedtime, school days and and ""always blocked"" is excellent.  Only complaint so far is that it seems easy to establish conflicting blocks, so if we want to give access to an app, it might also be blocked under another category/profile. It would be nice if there was the ability to see all of the controls applied to a specific app so that we can tell if it's blocked under any profile.  I recommend this app/service - worth the small hassle to keep our kids electronics usage within reasonable boundaries.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It just works! Need to get your kids to do their chores? Practice piano? Read? Do homework? Just add a ""task"" and as soon as they are done with the task, zoom more minutes on the tablet!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a really helpful app. It takes the argument out of getting my son to stop when his allotted tablet time is up.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is so bad,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love this app. My wizkid was able to hack out of two other parental sites, not this one. He now has positive motivation to complete his homework and chores. Thank you.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does exactly what I need to monitor usage of our devices,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is what's needed today when kids are so computer smart that just telling them to put the item down item down doesn't work . Now it completely disables the unit until the parent decides its time for it to come on again. It teaches discipline and also promotes kids to not be stuck on technology for 20 hours of the day. Maybe now kids will start going back outside and playing, or earning their time by doing chores and homework. Kids hate it so it must be doing what it's supposed to be doing.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a great app which has helped restore harmony to our house. Parents rate it 5, kids rate it 1.....that shouldn't surprise anyone given its purpose!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My daughter hates it, but without this app she would not have a phone PEROID!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"So far, I love everything about this app! I get emails when my son installs new apps and daily emails of his usage (apps and times used). It's the app telling him when its time to log off, not me. No more fighting with my son.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app! My kids device turns off after the time I choose, no more yelling and watching the clock. I can also use it for more than one child at a time for no additional cost. Love it!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app does exactly what it promises, and it's a great tool to help my son learn to use his phone responsibly. Beware of the reviews by disgruntled children! It is our job as parents to keep our children safe, and this app helps us do our job more easily.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very good at limiting time and access for my 7 year old. Time limit with reward time is great and has her motivated to earn more time. Plus I can tell what she's been doing without having to check her device. Nice work!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a parent of a few younger girls, this turned out to be the app that we were really looking for. It allows us to set customized schedules, yet if we want to temporarily override it it's simple and easy. We were very reluctant as a parent to get a tablet for our youngster, we were concerned that she may get addicted to it. This is the app that put us at ease , and I have to say it really works!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My girls hate it but man oh man I love it...great for all ages. Instant shut off when I choose.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to use I tell all my friends about it when they say they have issues with terr kids and there phones.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This ap has been great. All my kids now know that they have a time allowance on their device each day and once they used it up that's that. They can no longer access the games but they have accepted it and that means no more nagging from me and less screen time for them. Also like the reports showing where they are spending there time online.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The Screen Time app has changed my life!!! My kids are 10 and 6 and while I always wanted to keep their tablet time down to an acceptable level, the fact is, I work from home and get distracted. A timer set means NOTHING to a kid! I used the free trial of screen time and instantly loved it. Everything shuts off when their time is up (except for apps you want available to them) and they just accept it. There are no arguments. They can also do a chore or do something nice and earn extra time. I like that I can let them listen to music as much as they want , but block games and YouTube after a certain amount of time. Believe me, this app is incredible. Start your kids with it young, so they know this is just how it it.  My kids time is up, they put their tablets down, play with toys, go outside, hang out with me.... this is a dream come true for someone who has struggled with time limits and timers and keeping track of usage. Try it! Parents will not be disappointed!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Complete control over my daughter's screen time. Many of the 1 star reviews are children angry over the installation of the app which tells you what? It works!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I had this app on my son's Android tablet and it worked great. My son has upgraded to an iPod and it doesn't work very well on the highest platform. My son can shut it off my son can't write it off from his iPod and therefore I cannot limit the amount of time you spend on his iPod but the bedtime and school time features do work.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. I now have so much control and it is so easy. Kids hate this because it works so well! It is worth every $,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My daughter was outta control because of her electronics.  This app has made her life and ours so much more peaceful and organized.  Not to mention she does all her chores when asked and sometimes when not lol.  I no longer walk on eggshells in fear i am gonna get yelled at or growled at if i suggest she turns it off.  Even her therapist has seen a difference lol.  I recommend this to any parent that is even slightly struggling with controlling their kids electronic usage.  I would have rated it a 10.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"If you cut the monthly pay by half I would consider paying, or a one time purchase, but the charge is not worth the afford",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Only thing I'd like to see is a weekend blocker so I can set different times and limits at the weekend to in the week,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Nik's Dad:  The app works great.  My son doesn't like because I’ve effectively managed to limit his non-educational usage to 2 hours per day.  The app works extremely well, prompting my son’s original review as follows:             It tells me to update it. I can't find the button to update the screentime app. And it won't let me use any of my apps. It won't even let me use appstore. And it wont even let me use screentime app. IT IS USELESS.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a great app, it works just as expected. Our teenager hates it, but we are getting the control of his screen time as we want. if you want the best for your kids, if you want to limit their exposure to the electronics, this app is for you.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is horrible don't download it is  DUMB,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have always thought that locking kids out is wrong. It makes them tempted to break the rules and play extra.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Hi great app but are you computer and laptop compatible ? Thank you,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love that I don't need to take her (age 8) tablet away, the apps switch off when I want them to. I have control from my device. I can even alter limits while she's playing. Also I can set some apps to still work for bedtime, eg audio books. School time blocker is good too. Took me a while to work everything out eg there's a different time allowance setting for the weekend! I love the additional time earning function for praising good behaviour rather than taking it away for bad behaviour.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Changing review as while the concept is great this app has poor performance. I continually have to uninstall and reinstall to get my app to monitor my daughters tablet. I asked so help but in the end they had no fix so uninstalled. Waste of money.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Can't find a better app to track what is going on with your child.  I would rate six if i could!!!  To all the kids who rate it 1...maybe you should learn to play and actually talk to other kids like we had too.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This has ended the battle at bedtime!!   If your reading the reviews and they gave it one star I guarantee it came from the child.  My son was not happy when we started using this app but he has adjusted to it now.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Exactly. Its a waste of money and time, don't get it.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"we love this app!  My kids hate it because it shuts off at bedtime, limits how much time they spend on their tablets and tells me what they have downloaded - LOL.  This has saved so many arguments.  Once it's locked them out - tough - you have used your time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It all works great. However, the developer should either make it a paid app or make it known that this is a trail. I found the app itself very useful and I would have paid for it. However, I find it disheartening that the developer doesn't make it clear you HAVE to pay for this app after your trial or it wont work.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love the fact that i can lock the screens (both ipod and samsung tablet) at the same time for each kid. Works with making them more responsible on time management.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Put it on all kids devices and even on my niece device and it's awesome,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app but my kids aren't to happy because it limits their playtime,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent  app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great both on my daughter's Android and son's iPad. I can monitor them without hovering over their shoulder 24/7.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app. It's great at helping me limit my daughter's tablet time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It really works.  It is very useful for parents, although kids at the beginning do not like it at all.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I carefully compared all sorts of parental control applications but this is by far the best available. My kids don't like it because I can now successfully enforce the time limits I set for them. Ironically they are getting very ambitious in taking on all sorts of tasks and little chores to earn some additional times.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app,  relief and piece of mind.  Kids respect it too, they understand it is about safety and health.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My kids hate that I have the control but that's what we as parents NEED.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great but seems parent's app / website does not send extra minutes or task rewards to nook devices. Otherwise very good.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,A great tool to gameifu chores with the reward of more screen time.  Still has timing glitches on Android but fantastic ease of use and fantastic customer support.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We downloaded the app to limit our son's time on his tablet.   I can limit the fun he's but still allow him to use learning games.   I  had a question and the company responded promptly with an answer.  The app let's you earn extra time by doing chores/tasks.   His room has never been cleaner,  he is doing his own laundry,  at 7, and he is trying to encourage his younger brother in potty training.  All without us having to ask over and over again.   Great app!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I described the Screen Time app to a friend, and they kept asking about different features. Can you limit certain apps? Yes, it does that. Can you increase the limits temporarily? Sure! Everything they came up with can be done, plus it has online support (though I have not needed to use it). I realized that using it just makes sense. I wish I had read the documentation first though, as there's good advice there about talking to your kids.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app. Before we had this app every time my kids used their tablets we had usage fights. ""Just 5 more minutes!"", ""But I've only been on for a half hour!"" Etc. Now their allotted time runs out and they go outside and play. No questions asked. No complaints. I love it. And I can add or take away time each day if I want to. I love that I can see exactly what they're doing on their tablets from the convenience of my own phone too.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have 2 kids 7 & 9 it works great. I control everything from my cell phone. My kids went from being on their tablets all day to going outside or playing with their toys. I let them earn extra time by doing extra chores. THE HOUSE HAS NEVER BEEN CLEANER LOL.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We use this on our kids devices to monitor and keep them safe from the world. It's not a punishment but a precaution. Un-monitored kids don't learn boundaries and respect. Unfiltered Web activities lead to things like inappropriate pictures and conversion. Plus, you can't guarantee who is on the other end. Fake profiles are made every day. This app helps us to ensure we know who, what, when and how are kids are communicating. No app added without our approval. Thank you Screen Time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is a must have for parents. I have it installed on all five of my children's tablets. First, I love that I the monthly fee is a family rate and not per tablet which is great for those who need it for several devices. This app is the best out there for customization. I can allow for certain apps (book reader apps) to not be counted for their daily time limit and allow for certain apps to be used later than others (no game apps after a certain time but can still allow book reading apps). I also really love that they can earn more minutes by completing tasks/chores. Another great feature is being able to block apps that you do not want your child to access. One of our favorites is the play and pause feature. When it's time to eat, we pause the tablets so we can eat without electronics being an issue. While my children might not be happy with it 100% of the time, they understand the need for the app and have adjusted well to having it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My son hacked the app over and over again, and it was easy for him to do. This is not for teenagers. It never worked. Every month I complained and asked for help. Never offered a credit or refund. Don't waste your time.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My kids got tablets for Christmas this year. For the first month it seemed like they were on them 24/7. I installed this on them and really loved being able to not only set limits on certain apps, but also I could set it so that their educational apps could be used any time. And being able to change settings, check on them & see when they add apps, etc from my phone is amazing. We've had it for 2 months & I'd highly recommend. It's worth the money ($40/year per family after the free trial month).",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Ignore the kids this app really helps manage the time kids spend on their electronics,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love that I can customize what apps are restricted and what apps are part of the daily time limit. It's very helpful to have the daily summaries of how my kids spend their time on the device, and I can even check the log to know if they're on it at school when they should be paying attention in class! We have been extremely happy with Screen Time!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app helps you to set boundaries and enforce them. You get to keep your sanity.  I recommend the 'uninstallable' version for tech savvy kids who would try to circumvent lesser apps.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We tried a few different things to ""negotiate"" screen time with our kids. This is by far the best solution we've found. We talked to the kids when we set things up. Even though they didn't like it, at least they knew what was going on. We don't argue about screen time, they know how much they have, and which apps they can use, and they manage their own time. I love the real-time reporting, the daily emails, and the flexibility. We can shut devices down with a few screen taps, or give them more time because of special situations. We can also reward them for getting certain tasks done. I can set limits for all the kids across all our devices. I HATE paying for apps, but this is well worth the yearly subscription cost.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a GREAT app and value.  There is a reason so many kids are giving bad reviews here!  The best part is they know that I know what they are doing.  During the growing up years, they need that guidance and will accept the idea if it is fair.  One hour per day and two hours on the weekend with listening to appropriate music unlimited.  If they're behavior gets out of hand or responsibilities not done, then all is blocked until they change.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Easy to use and you can block as much or as little as you want. You can teach children how to use tablets responsibly.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,No feedom,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has allowed me to monitor what apps my kids are using. I can block apps I don't want them using and they actively enjoy earning extra time by doing jobs ( yes sometimes they moan but hey that's life lol.) I can also pause and restart it when needed which is handy for long car trips.    P.s   I block Google play so they can't add apps that are not right for their age 5 stars 😀,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is so easy to use and allows me to control their tablet usage. You can control how much time they have on them and also what apps they can or cannot use. I also like the block function so instead of taking their tablets away and hiding them because they are on a ban it's now just a click of a button and they can't access anything!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My kids hate this app. But the electronics were becoming an addiction in our house.  So I tried this, it worked. It loses a star because it's hard to dial in just right. But it does what it says",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My wife and I cannot stand over our kids' shoulders every time they pick up their phones so a tool like Screen Time helps us in so many ways. Its easy to set up and the daily reports are great.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"With this app, I can control three fundamental parameters on my kids devices: what they can use, when they can use it and for how long each day. What more a parent can ask?",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has no password protect from a parent's device.  Both kids hacked it today and changed settings.  I am told password protect is something they are considering adding in the future.  Until then, app isn't worth much and not worth paying for.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I like this app. I think that the price was reasonable and that it is effective and easy to use. I like that we can shut down certain apps and only have other ones available at certain times. I would recommend it to people.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has a lot of glitches and a monthly fee. One, it resets the time and date to a random time in date in the previous years. Two, random shutdowns occur on my child's device ever since I got this app for him. Three, if you want to make a change in the settings, you have to change it from your child's device and if you don't, it WONT take effect. So, this app is not worth the fee OR the time wasted trying to adjust the settings to where it is perfect. Too many bugs. And, my child was experiencing a time glitch, where it would say a specific time, but it would end/start an hour LATER, saying that they was the correct time for it to disable/start a setting. Would be a decent app, if not for the fee and all of the glitches. Even so, I do not recommend it and I am considering majorly uninstalling it. Would give it a negative amount of stars if I could.",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This App is excellent. It works perfectly and is so versatile.  No more fights with the children about too much time in their tablets. My wife even asked to be added to control her Facebook time!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Amazing app! Thank u so much for creating this app!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love, love, love, love, love it",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app! Now when it's bedtime she sleeps and no more issues at school with my daughter using her phone she she is not suppose to be on it in class.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,If you want to make sure your child is using their phone appropriately download this app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works well. A much needed application well done. Thank you Screen Time Labs!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My husband and I love the screentime app and our kids hate it. :) It enforces the rules we already had set up for them. I am less stressed about keeping track of their time on devices (4 of 5 kids have devices to play on and they only have one mom!) because I know it will kick them off when their time is up, and it's not unilateral. We decide which apps are blocked and when. I just wish we could install it on our desktop computer as well!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it! Easy to use. Great way to control your kid's device.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Loving this app!  I can limit the amount of time that my son places on his electronic devices and know what he is doing during his screen time.  This app allows me to lock him out of specific apps such as the play store so he cannot just randomly download apps that pop up on the screen.  Before I enabled the lock-out of the play store I was able to ensure that he would review an app with me before playing an new app.  Great app and would definitely recommend it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Spend less time arguing with your child and more time with your child. Parents, if you love your children, you're gonna love this app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Just get it. Seriously.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this... Curfew no longer ignored.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Don't listen to the kids...I am a parent and I LOVE this for my 3 kid's tablets. I can track what and when and how much time they are spending on their technology. Finally a way to take some control back. I had even decided to pay for the continued protection - and I rarely buy anything online!! Highly recommend to any parent feeling frustrated.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My son's 'fone time' is totally controlled using this app. I have also recommended this app to friends & family. I am not the kind who buys app, this is the 1st purchase that I made in this lifetime, since I have tried it & found it super useful. Would strongly recommend this to any moms out there facing the 'sticky gadget' problem. Having full access & knowledge to what your kid does on his fone .... is totally God sent!!! Thank you very much .....",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Waste of time just to piss kids off,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It works well and when their time is up I am not the bad guy,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Simple way to track how long you children are on their tablets 😊,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app but not paying for premium version tooooo expensive.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works really well. I have used this for 2 months and have my son's screen time usage under control now. I was concerned as i wasn't able to manage it on my own. He spends a bit more time doing other things now which is great!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I Love this App. I used to turn off Wifi at nights to make sure my kids got enough sleep, now I just set Bed Times and don't worry about it. Better then time outs, and you have full control of what Appts kids can download and manage them. I highly recommend this Appt to any parent.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Perfect tool to help me manage my kids screen time and keep them safe while online!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is okay but there is not a single parental control app that will do it all I have had to run this app and another one together in order to get the coverage that I want,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app used to be good when set time limit feature was part of the free app. Now none of the app features are available without buying the subscription. The price is pretty hefty for what it offers so I will have to pass and look to other alternatives.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app to monitor kids tablet usage. Kids may disagree, but parents will love it!!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It sucks,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Very helpful. Tells us exactly which apps our kids are using and how long they use them. Not only does our teen daughter spend more time in the real world now, I feel safer being able to monitor and control which apps she uses.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app which helped me to menage time my kids spend on devices,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Nice features, and worth every euro, great support.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Within 4 days my 5 yr old daughter was rationing and planning out her daily use of the tablet. Well worth the cost for a child and great develoment tool. Although maybe not a teenager as they'll more than likely figure out how to uninstall it.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Excellent! Helps negotiate many things with the kid, encourage him complete daily tasks. Parents and other related adults may each respond to the requests and control the kid's usage from their own devices.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have four kids, plenty of phones and tablets and I found this application the most effective than any other I've tried. It does exactly what it has too.  (the only minor issue I know is that it limits time per device, not per child. however, this issue doesn't worth a star to minus)",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Of all the parent apps I researched, this is the one to get: Works exactly as it claims - simple, doesn't try to do too much (like so others), isn't overly invasive (I'm not sure I trust the code of several of the others!) - and reasonably priced.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I used to have such a hard time to get my kids to do their chores. Now their phones are blocked until their chores are done. Once I see that their chores are done I unblock their phone. I love love love this app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Got this because my son is grounded but he needed to be able to reach me in case of emergency.  This gave us the ability to lock up his phone yet still have the ability to contact us if needed. When he gets in grounded if ever I can still control when it is locked up verifying that at 8 when all electronics are to be shut off they are truly sit off. Thanks for the awesome app!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app helps me very much especially during school n bedtime,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I am in charge of two 8 years old kids. We have an excellent relationship, we dialogue and have well established rules. However, full Internet access results in exposing them to inappropriate contents, out of my control. I don't want to suspend gaming, because I myself like to play games. ScreenTime solved the problem. I negotiate times and rules with my kids, and now they enjoy their time gaming safely. I suggest kids who are rating this app with one star start a dialogue with their parents instead.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,But that's the idea. It gives me full insight and full control.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is the worst app ever, don't get it. This app sucks and is glitchy. Give your child a chance to have freedom to there phone. I mean seriously, my mom did not even give me a chance and this is my first phone and she put this app on it before she even gave it to me. But I does glitch a lot!",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"When my 13-year old daughter got wind of the Instagram, Kit, Skype(!!😒👎👎😒!!), etc. craze & ""friends"" she could share with, she got lost. I panicked. We argued ALOT.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Some bits of the interface are not very intuitive and the syncing between devices is a bit laggy. Else it's awesome. Frustrated kids bring the app rating down from what it should be, so don't worry about that. It's quite funny actually.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great on Android. My kid understands why we use screentime and actually likes the tasks system.  Most bad reviews here are by kids. Which actually means it is working..  But I would recommend talking with your kid and explain why you use it as a team.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My five year old was using the tablet all day until he would drain the battery. And then he would get back on it as soon as it was half charged. It was getting out of hand and this forces him to find better ways to spend his time. The only thing I don't like is the companion app, which is pretty much useless and you are forced to download it.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Parents, you don't realize how this makes your kids feel about you. I am 12 and I hate it. It just makes me so upset and it makes me what to throw my tablet in the trash. It is so frustrating. My tablet is pretty much rendered useless. It just pops up in the middle of your game, then you lose all of your progress. DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP OR SCREEN TIME COMPANION APP PLEASE.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app. It gives options to prioritize phone time for the kids. I've looked for an app that I can use to give me some insight into how much time my kids are on their phones. With screentime I can limit the amount of time the kids are on specific apps, while giving them incentives to do chores around the house for more screen time usage. Thx guys! Well done.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I was so tired of fighting with my teenagers to get off of their phones. This app is very flexible. The app has done its job perfectly for us. The only ""problems"" we have ever had are that my kids don't like my rules. One daughter did manage to uninstall it once, but we were immediately notified and were given instructions on how to reinstall it from the developer's website so that they can't remove it through Google Play. The tasks feature is indispensable. I am seriously impressed with this app. Love it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is easy to set up and use.  I really like that it's so customizable. I can let my son use an app (Audible) all that he wants and it doesn't count against his daily limit like games do. I can also override easily (from my device or his) and allow him access to an app temporarily. I also appreciate the notifications and Tim e summaries.  There are chores and tasks that I can set up that he can complete to earn more time.  He of course didn't enjoy the restrictions at first, but now he's accepted the reasonable guidelines just like any other parental guidelines in his ten year old life.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does what I need it to do,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is AMAZING. We have 5 kiids including foster kids and there's no more trying to keep everyone to their one hour week day screen time - and I love how they can be offered awards for more time for extra chores done or for cooperating or whatever. Very versatile. And the reports on what they're spending time on is fhelpful too.  So so appreciative for this app!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We installed this app on our 3 kids devices as well as my phone strictly for convenience. With the free trial we showed them what it was capable of, and outlined our expectations. As long as they are reasonable, we are too! We have not yet seen the need for a subscription as it works well as it is, although I occasionally miss being able to remotely tinker with their devices from my own. Thank you so much for your product. Being able to keep an eye on what my teenagers are doing online is important!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome app. Saves arguing over taking the phone away.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is the best app ever. I'm able to control the amount of time my 6 year old daughter could be on her tablet playing her games without having to take the tablet from her or keep track of how longs she's been on it, myself. What I love most about this app is that I can use my phone as a remote to enable or disable her games, without having the tablet in front of me. I have recommended this app to all my coworkers who have children and they have said they will get it. Every parent with tablets, needs to have this app for their children.",5

Worked wonderfully with android but had a few kinks with my child's iphone 6s (we the parents have android phones).

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I was looking 4 a way 2 have some control over my 6yr old son's tablet he received from his dad a couple months ago. I was so tired of arguing with him 2 get off of it to do ANYTHING including just play with his toys. I was seriously 2 the point if it ""accidentally"" getting broken. My son and I spend a lot of time doing things together and the stupid tablet had ruined that too because if he wasn't on it, he was mad at me 4 making him get off so we weren't having any good quality time. Well this app saved us",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Enjoyed the use for a while, paid for yearly, but it started having issues saying time changed and wouldn't let kids play.  Was fine when we were near but when they weren't home with us couldn't get on without our passcode to fix.  Gave up after a while and just removed.  When it worked it was great.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is great.  My son wasn't too pleased but i explained why i put it on and he seems fine now.  He  realizes he only has a certain time and will find other things to do so he doesn't run out of time before he is finished with a game or such.  i'm glad i found this app because i was getting concerned how much he was on his phone.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very handy for keeping the boys tablet use in check. The time limit has made them realise what a waste of time Stampy videos are and they are more careful spending their limited time. Time rewards are good carrots. The ability to select which apps are blocked gives them the freedom to use educational and more productive apps even when their time is up.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The free trial was great. When it can time to get the premium package, my cards kept being denied. Once they get PayPal connected to their domain, I would love to utilize this app for all my kids.",3

I can set the different settings based on the age and needs of my specific children.  I also now receive a daily summary of the apps that were used.  A true parents dream come true.  Worth every penny.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've been looking for an app that would help me manage my three kids device usage. This is it. I'm a very tech savvy dad, can do all kinds of clever stuff with my network, but this app is still better. Ignore the bad reviews, they are mainly by kids! It's easy to set up, very actively updated, and the features it's currently lacking are in the pipeline. It was the easiest decision to subscribe for the premium service when the free trial expired (V. Good value IMO)",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Devices and apps are like the candy stores, fairs, and circuses of this generations. Most of the things you can do on them should be privileges, not something your children feel entitled to that distracts them from everything that's important. Screen Time let's you set and enforce those limits on apps that need time restrictions and allows you to reward children for completing tasks with more time. Kids who hate this only do because they can't spend all day at the circus anymore.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Do I have to subscribe to the  premium app to actually get this to work & be able to change settings? That sucks & should be in your description.  What's the point?

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I believe this is (if not the first) the best app for attempting to control the always challenging and unpredictable activities of young people while on their phones/tablets. It gives control back to the parent who wishes to be more involved in the choices being made by their kids.  I really like being able to monitor what's being installed and decide if it's appropriate for them.  Furthermore I can even decide if it's to be used at school and/or bedtime and whether or not it counts toward daily time limits or not.  I gave it only 4 stars because there still are a few things needed to make it fully functional.  Such things as coupling the time awarded through ""task"" and the ""play"" functions to the daily time remaining.  In my opinion, these 2 time amounts should be accounted for in the ""Time Remaining"" graphic.  This is because both parents/caregivers/grand parents might be copied in a request for extra time.  Each person might award extra play time before they have a chance to coordinate with the other people.  10 extra minutes is not much time until it's multiplied by 2 parents and 2 grandparents.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is easy to use, diverse, and inexpensive. Well worth the annual fee! Both kids have accepted the new limits well. My daughter's reading time has tripled!

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Managing my children's mobile device use is among the most complicated things I do in a day.  Screen Time simplifies part of it, enabling various automated controls, but then it also adds to the work involved.  This is a good thing, since, otherwise, I wouldn't be paying as close attention to how much time my children are spending with their device and, in particular, what they're doing.  Among the most valuable features Screen Time offers is the ability to limit the daily use of one set of apps, while making another set open to unlimited use.  I've enabled my daughter to listen to audiobooks on Audible to her heart's content, but skimming BuzzFeed articles costs against her daily usage.  It's clear the app has been improving and the team behind it is committed to supporting users and making further improvements.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The idea of this app is very good.  I can only speak for what I have experienced after a few weeks of usage as a premium customer.  There is an inconsistency in the actual usages of a device and what is reported in the parent monitor and sent in the daily reports.  I have had to perform a ""Reconnect"" process on all three devices on more than one occasion.  Again the idea of the app is great and for this I will give 3 stars and recommend it to friends.  However, they really need to perform some more tests to ensure these issues are addressed.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great idea and we have ways now of them getting up at the right time in the morning and homework being done.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I recommend this app.  I use it in an ""open/fair"" way with my 11-year old son, namely, I explained him that he should see it as a help for himself against gaming addiction.  Nothing is secret, I tell him every couple of days how much he gamed, and I set for him a weekly limit.  I also told him that it would be for him a piece of cake to find a nerdy classmate who could help him to cheat, but I am teaching him to appreciate  and understand that this path has a dead end.  I find incredible that kids are allowed to give nasty ratings to this app, only because they are frustrated not to be able to cheat.  If a were a parent of one of such kids, cell phone and tablets would be off limits for a while.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is definitely a must needed app for all parents of children.   You can monitor phone time and help motivate your child with additional phone time with chores, on time homework, good attitudes, etc.  Screen time customer service is great and a fast response.   It is seriously by far the best app I've ever used to monitor my teenagers.   Thanks screentime for helping me feel safer with my kids on their smart phones.",5

Customer service have been brill and we are very happy!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"No app is perfect though, I hope future updates will allow for individual daily bedtime instead of just week and weekend. Also choice of auto daytime shutdown times any time of day, not just school time. This would be useful for homework after school later in the day. Overall this app is convenient, intuitive for both parents and kids, and the customer service is there when needed.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app that gives me a large degree of control over my childrens' tablet time.  Very powerful and works for multiple devices.  Don't believe the one-star reviews being left by angry kids; get this app!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"They need just a few more tweeks to be the best protection app out. Its user friendly and easy to set up. The kids hate it but I know they are protected. I love the pause play features. The task /reward time feature, the school time & lights out feature!! LOVE IT LOVE IT!!",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I don't have kids of my own, but I have my little niece which I care for her a lot. At the beginning, after I've installed Screen time  she was very upset. I had to explain to her all about the ""BAD"" things and dangers that kids can encounter  on the Internet. Gladly she understood and ever since the time she use to expend on her device now is being used in some other activities which doesn't require a device or internet. Screen time is the best sidekick for a parent.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. It's amazing. I can add tasks for my 5 year old to earn extra time. I can also monitor from afar which is great since I travel for work. It's a great way for my sons to learn limits and the value of earning.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app it makes it so easy to control my kids screen time with consistency,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Went thru and set bed times and school times allowing for 4pm -9pm use, she still can't use the tablet between those times.  I have to go in and manually do like the car ride option to open time for her everyday and it became such a hassle that I just deleted it....even after paying to use all options available.  Very disappointed",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great App! Don't be put off by the number of 1 star reviews, as they're all from kids! You get full control over how long they can play, and what apps to block. You also get a daily email letting you known what they've been up to! Well worth the subscription fee",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Frustration of my kids was high. But with some reasoning they understand now why. I love the feature of earning screen time.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Amazing app!  It works very well for what it is designed to do.  You can set time limits for school, bedtime, and block any specific app all the time.  You can see when and how long any app is used.  I think my favorite feature is the ability to give my son tasks through the app for a reward for extra time.  Overall I highly recommend it!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is the one and only app that works this well. Grateful for this. Keep developing this app. It is vital. Also, kids are giving the companion app a low rating. That means it really works. ;-) There are imperfections. Hope developers will keep improving it!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is great and the pause button makes it so easy to get the children ready and out of the door. The bedtime feature is a godsend, allowing me to let them have a little downtime before shutting off apps for a good night sleep. I can't fault it although they kicked against to begin with they settled down quick enough",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app! Great idea and has really helped my kids manage their screen time. Highly recommended!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love being able to control what apps my kids are allowed to us on their tablets so they aren't getting into trouble on them... I also like the pause and play features...,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does not work,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is a good one as parents can have full control on kids android or I phones. Parents can know how long apps are being used on kids phone or tablet. I really recommend  it and if kids are too long on apps parent can block it remotely. Lots of kids are leaving bad feedback in order to prevent parents from using it. Try and decide.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is absolutely fantastic for parents who are concerned about the effect that excessive and unmonitored usage of electronic devices have on their children.  This app allows parents to grant children some freedom, but within the restraints they feel are appropriate for their children.  Highly recommended.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We are really happy overall with this app and feel it is well worth the monthly fee to be able to limit our children's screen time and see what apps they are using.  I contacted customer support with a problem after subscribing and got a quick response, so great customer service!  One feature I would like to see added is the ability to vary the bedtime by day (later on weekends).",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app that allows me to manage my children's screen time.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Best app I've ever paid for. The only people that I know of that don't like it are kids, as they don't like rules. This app not only helps parents keep those rules enforced while they are at work & can't be physically with their child 24/7 but it also helps to reward them also.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I had this for about a month, while it does limit and even stop app usage, it's a little bit traumatizing. And it glitches out SO MUCH, 90% of the time I couldn't use apps that my guardian unlocked because the screen time was glitched, Being my incredible determination to bypass this wretched app, I found a glitch to use most apps. I would tell you however they will patch it. In short, this app is the most irritating and demeaning thing I know of, it makes you feel powerless, weak.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Good app to monitor, limit and manage devices of your children of various ages. Paid version is good but it wasn't clear to us originally that it was a paid service. None the less I still recommend it, if you are willing to pay for the monthly fee.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Extremely useful. Too bad it's not yet available for Mac OSX/Win yet.,5

When she wants more time....she simply does chores or does something nice. I am grateful for apps like these. They make the techno world just a little easier on parents.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Absolutely fantastic app! My son was always stuck on mobile but eversince I have installed this app, he started to spend more time on other activities.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Why.....,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have 9 kids.  8 have tablets.  This is a great app for setting limits.  The kids know what to expect expect and I can limit their screen time.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"5 stars is an insufficient measure of how fantastic this app is, I give it 136 stars. Not that there isn't room for improvement, but the underlying concept is unique and sound. I've tried other apps to lock down my daughter's phone, it leads to fights, and her figuring out how to exploit bugs in the software to bypass the lock. I've also tried chore charts over the years, and it never motivated her. With screen time, she's accepted the lock down, and is excitedly doing more chores to earn more time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does all that I could ever ask for in managing my step son's phone!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We recently bought phones for our kids as a Christmas present. I was a little concerned at giving them uninhibited access to apps & the Internet but this app means I don't have to worry. I can see exactly what they are looking at & downloading, they can't use the phone after bedtime or before school & they can't use it when they hit their daily limit. I can also block any new apps. This app puts you totally in control. No wonder the kids are complaining! Worth every penny!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. I have it installed on all of my children's devices. I wish it had a feature to uninstall apps on their devices.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a good app to use. Easy to navigate and allows customization for everything.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I uninsulated the ap because I found it hard to use. The bedtime portion was confusing.  Instead of just being able to put a start and end time it made me put like 23 or 22 etc. I could never seem to get the time correct. it should be straight forward and I don't understand why you would make it like that.  I will be using a different ap.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Y does it need to use my camera???,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I can control the usage on my sons phone but when i turn off the school or bedtime blocker in my phone i have to go to his phone to do it. It also is not showing any history for the previous 5 days.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works even better than expected.  I love the detail and up-to-date messages on activity. This has enabled us to prevent some sneaking around in the middle of the night, and turned around our kid's grades.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is exactly what I needed to monitor and track my kids screen time.  Great product.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app's bad reviews are mostly from kids...that being said; this is a great app that encourages my kids to other things besides....electronics!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Its AWESOME,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a great app packed with lots of good features....lots less arguing about time limits now! I love that I can see new apps my son downloads and have to ok them before he has access to them....as well as being able to see how much time he spends on each app.The time limit feature is great but.....The four stars is because it needs to have a time limit across all devices belonging to one child instead of each device being separate, in effect giving them double their time limit.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has helped very much with homework and bedtime. If a chore has not been completed I can easily turn the phone off until it's finished. This app has also helped with earning phone time. Highly recommend this.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It a great app for the parents to have.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have 4 kids. They get no screen time until I get a picture of there bed made and room clean in the morning then they get there 1st hour. So great. Can see new apps and block apps. Worth the money,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Fantastic app.  I have my son back again!!! It's also teaching him to ration his allowed time and to plan in advance what he uses.   Highly recommended to any parent with a screen-obsessed child!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Screentime has saved us from soooo many meltdowns since it was installed. Heaps of great features such as auto adding all new installed apps means sneaky kids can't get around the time limit.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This does exactly what I need it to do as a parent. I can block specific apps during school hours and bed time. I can block settings so my kid can't change the settings of her phone. Even she likes this control app better than the free versions. This is honestly the best app I have found to date and we have been using it for almost a year.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it!  A must have application for a parent of a child with an Android device.  This app has mitigated much of the evening drama of stepping away from the screen.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,No arguing over phones or tablets anymore. No using phones after bed time and I can prevent my daughter from using potentially dangerous social media. I can even view Web history. Downside is not ios compatible and no geo-fence for children's whereabouts. Otherwise it's brilliant. A must buy.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I liked this app, it was effective and easy to use and works well with the android tablet. The major downfall I find, is I can not get it to work properly on my sons ipod. He is the main one I wanted to use this app on.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Used a few of these but this is best by far,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great App!  like the controls and the ability to just limit game time without effecting music app or word.  so if they need to do homework on the device but already used their allotted time, they can.  the app will block games and still allow access to other apps, you pick and choose which ones. also like the fact that if they want more time then what you allotted their is a task list that can give your kids more time(great way to get kids to do chores).",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've tried several of the apps out there and I like this one the best. They often fix issues or add suggested features. My kids HAVE found loop holes, which Screen Time fixed. I've been using it for over a year now with my kids from 15 down to 8. It allows me to send them time after they complete a task,  like homework. And it allows me to choose what apps to allow during times like school or bedtime. In fact, the ""lights out"" feature, where all apps stop working at a specified time is my favorite.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I understand that the ratings of this app might be much lower than it should be. Some kids may hate it but they soon learn to live with the rules.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We really like this app. It has help maintain peace. Our son likes the fact that he can get more time after chores. Unfortunately, now that he has a new Hauwie phone device the app will not work with it. I hope they fix it soon.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Work great love it I don't mind paying but I think 40 is a lot,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Definitely worth every penny, I went in for the full two years  The reward system built into tasks is really unique and a great motivator.  Zero issues with the quality of either Screentime or RC.  Note that most of the bad reviews of Screentime are being done by the kids.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome app. In today's world. Kids are smarter than the parents. This app. Levels the playing fields. It's easy to use. Tech support is wonderful. It protects your kids from entering places you don't want them to go or websites you don't want them visiting. I had Verizon family base and cancelled it when I got this app. My child is so much more protected and I have peace of mind. THIS APP IS TRULY AMAZING. Coming from a mother of 5 that is impressed!!!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Does what it says it does, and easy to use.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I believe that this app should stack your daily limit so that you can have more time on different days,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,HATED IT,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It is the best parental controls for a kids phone I have been able to find.  I would like a few more features such as being able to allow my daughter to use her internet browser only in school, and put individualized time limits on different apps.  Unfortunately I have to block her browser altogether, instead of just during non-school hours and I put no time limits at all on skype, so that she can visit with her grandma without draining her digital time.  I would like to put a limit on that though because she also skype's her friends and it can add up to many hours on the weekend.  If I were to increase her time limit and add skype into the apps that are timed she would just play more video games on the weekends she doesn't happen to skype.  I also want a way to control who she can skype more.  I want a locked feature that makes it so I choose who she can call and receive calls from skype.  I realize it is a separate app, but it is a bothersome situation.  It's a great way to have face to face contact with far away family and friends, but not safe enough for comfort with teens.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This has helped my child focus more on school and earn our trust.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Can't go premium. Says error 503 whats the problem,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Yes it costs money. What doesn't? But what is the cost in aggro between you and your kids in what is an acceptable screen time use? After an initial meltdown following installation of screen time, they now accept that these limits are okay. They now plan when they want to use their tablets in the day and when to go out. I cannot fault the app on useability, functionality and the feedback it gives. On the price: perhaps once the development costs are covered the developers can choose a lower price point?",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Screen time has changed the dynamics in my home.  My kids now argue over chores they get to do to earn more time on their tablets.  Dinner or family time?  We just put a block on their electronics now for 30 or 60 minutes.  Someone sneaking their phone to their room?  Bed time limits kills that!  Auto blocks new installed apps until you approve.  For my teens and tweens, it gives us control over their screen time and rewards good behavior.  I only wish I had this much control over the Xbox!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's been so great since we've installed this app... We no longer have the struggles and arguments from our kids about when they can use their pad, yes they weren't happy at first but once they realized they don't have us harping at them anymore because the boundaries are set and mom and dad don't have to take their electronics away there has been nothing but peace in our family!!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Worked until kids figured out how to disable it. It needs to have administrator rights on the phone and block access to settings. Good concept. Subscription model great for developer but pricing steep for what it actually does.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I am very happy with this app. This is the only app my child has not found a way to get around. Great, fast response from customer service as well. Please note as you're going through the reviews: 1 star reviews from kids means it's working!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app had been fantastic for limiting and restricting our children's time on their tablets. It has very granular controls over which apps can be used when and for how long. They can also be adjusted for each child. Keep in mind that while the app is free,  to fully take advantage of the features, you have to subscribe to the service. In my opinion, it's money well spent. I can't say enough good things about it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Finally we got rid of arguments every time we'd tell the kids their time was up! There is still a bit of frustration on their part from time to time but this is where we the parents have to communicate with our kids and reason with them. The only option missing is the ability to revoke minutes for today or tomorrow. Then it would be perfect!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app.  So great.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app as my son has realised that good behaviour = good rewards. The only downside is that sometime when I allow extra playtime is doesn't show up on my son's phone. It seems to allow playtime of its own accord. These occurrences are not very often but sometimes can be annoying for both of us. Other than that I highly rate this.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has solved so much stress. It is very easy to use and the real time support is very quick and efficient. I no longer have to nag my kids to get off their devices and they accept that 'tablet time' is over much better with out me having to say anything. It is also easy to treat them and give them extra time for car journeys or a reward - they have even volunteered to do their homework to get another 10 minutes! I also really liked the trial period as a test for the app, but I have now signed up. Thank you",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We love this app! It can be difficult as a parent to monitor screen time & control apps/what is or is not OK on our son's tablet.  This app lets us set the online boundaries, lock-out access at certain times of the day (night time/school time) and monitor what is being viewed & how the tablet is being used.  I love being able to offer additional times via tasks completed (they can also send a picture to confirm)  that need to be approved by the parent, not just automatically given.  The option of being able to review & change settings is really easy/user friendly.   Overall, the yearly cost for this app is well worth it & economical. Let's face it - kids are now on their tablets/computers/phones daily!!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I'm a parent and I've been looking for an app like this for some time now.   Reviewed a few like this but settled on this one.  Pretty flexible in many ways and Screen Time Labs seems to be eager to improve upon it.    Being able to control my 8 yr old son's tablet from my phone is awesome.  He can contact me via the app and let me know if his home work is done or not and I can give him more time (or not).  Bedtime is now easy to enforce without having to confiscate the device, it just shuts off the apps he would normally be using all while leaving useful apps enabled such as his Clock for his wake up alarm.  Have to say, when I read the reviews and saw other parents who liked the app and then saw kids not liking so much, I knew it was worth looking closer at ....  At the end of the 14 day trial, I gladly subscribed for a year, which is a lot less than competing products.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's one of the best parental control apps out there but it's hard to keep tabs on your kids if it doesn't sync with your kids phone. Sometimes the app would say they have an hour to play when I've noticed that they've used more than that hour. Or you can block apps for them but then sometimes they would be available for them to use. I liked it a lot but it's not useful when it's not doing its job.  Thay do have excellent customer service that's why I'm giving 3 stars,3

I think we're on the right track! We use it with varying degrees of control based on their ages and level of electronics addiction. The premium subscription is totally worth it. The ability to remotely pause or play the device from your own phone with a message about why has really come in handy. Responsive tech support as well!,5

The only problem was it never worked reliably and in the end I uninstalled it out of frustration.   The good news is that Screen Time just works and after experiencing an app that just locked their phones and refused to unlock them they are quite accepting of Screen Time.   Now there's a strategy: install another parental control app first so your kids experience the worst, then install Screen Time and they'll thank you for it!  It's also well designed and intuitive from a usability perspective. Well done Steve and team!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I was looking for an app that would allow me to both monitor time on my kids tablets and see what they are doing/viewing. Screen Time does both and more. Setting time limits was eye opening to me as it really showed me just how much time they WOULD be spending on their tablets, if in fact there wasn't any hardened time limit. As a parent, you can tell the kids how much time they have, but this app helps ENFORCE it. I like how tasks and task approvals are incorporated. And it is very easy to check on app totals and app usage while I am at work (on my laptop) or from anywhere on my phone. With the security, the kids are not able to mess around with settings or uninstall, which they have tried to do! All around, a great parental control app. The customer service has been excellent with any questions that I've had. The only thing I would wish to see is exactly which YouTube videos were watched, although I am not sure if any parental control app can tell you this. I can go on their tablets and look at the video history. I have the YouTube settings set to Restricted Mode and the Google Play apps set to age appropriate apps, which does help with ensuring appropriate content.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is an amazing app. It allows you to designate the amount of time your child is to be on their phone or tablet. It allows you to choose what they can access and block what you don't want them to use. It also allows you to set it up so they can earn extra time on their phone or tablet doing chores completeing homework amongst other things. I'm sure there are other features that are these that are just not coming to mind right this second. Lol. But all around it is an amazing app. #GiveItAShot,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best thing go....A/1,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is an excellent app.  We have 4 boys 8 and under who all got small tablets for Christmas.  We were nervous to give these to them knowing that we didn't want their days to become consumed by too much screen time.  But we also realized that time they play can be fun and relaxing for them and educational too.  This app has allowed us to set that fear aside in more ways than we had even thought about.  Not only can we successfully limit the time they spend on their tablets, we can keep track of what they are doing by monitoring their apps, set up the start and end times for the day, block certain apps, giving them extra minutes if needed, turn off the tablets if things have to be done instead.  And a side benefit has been that they are learning how to monitor their own time.  Often they will turn them off because they want to ""save"" time for later in the day.  I think that's a skill in learning how to use your time.  We have already recommended Screen Time to many people.  Technology is a privilege and we know as parents it is our job to make sure that it keeps a proper place for our children when their young minds don't understand that concept yet.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,He's 10 and has a few different devices and tends to fall asleep sometimes after me and so having the bed time blocker is great.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's easy for kids and parents to lose track of how much time is spent on electronics.  This helps it stay in check.  I've even thought about using it for myself to keep from overdoing time in social media etc.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I just love this app. We no longer have daily arguments with the kids over how long they spend on electronics. No arguments about bed time. No seeking downstairs in the middle of the night to play videogames. Thank-you screen time for restoring peace to our house.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"All of the 1 star ratings will be from kids whose parents have installed this app, and now they think their world is going to end. It is a brilliant app, its a very good way to get the kids to not only earn playing time, but to stop it with no quarrels when its over.  The only bugbears I have are with the IOS version, but thats mainly Apple's stupid app limitations. It seems expensive though, it would be better with a one time cost, and not a subscription model.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awful,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Fantastic App! The kids may not like it for obvious reasons. But it allows me to keep a check on what apps etc they're using, how long they're on them.. Allows me to set suitable limits and restrictions and block unsuitable content. Really pleased with the app, its well worth it..",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It keeps allowing my kids to go over their allotted time without my permission.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Tested 20+ apps before settling on this one. These guys really did it right. One of few that supports the scenario where kids have their own device. Great app complemented with a great Web service.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great quality app, I recommend taking the trial and try out all the premium features.   My children like the option to earn extra time on the phone by completing certain tasks..ex:15 more minutes if you help your little sister with her homework.   I  like that I have the option to shutdown certain apps at the end of the day and receive daily emails of phone activity.   Thanks so much!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have used older version of this and earlier they did not charged any money for locking of apps. But now the are charging money. Hate it.....,1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It has given me freedom to keep my relationship with my daughter and help them control their time on their phone without a lot of fighting.  I totally recommend it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Its a great idea, but the reason I got and paid for this was so I can monitor what my kids are doing while I'm at work. And so far I've had nothing but issues with one or both of my boys' tablets not being connected to my phone. Feel like I may have wasted my money here",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Really helps us keep our kids' tablet usage under control.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Amazing!! When I don't want my kids on their tablet I just shut it down remotely from my own phone!!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app! I was having a hard getting my daughter to get off her phone & tablet. She hates the app and tried several times to get password until she got locked out of the phone. I'm sure she will think twice before trying that again. She was able to sign in as guest on tablet to get around it. I was trying to figure out how she was able to stay on pass the time allotted. Thanks so much for this app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We use this app to monitor and control what our 4 young kids are doing on their tablets. I especially love that I can control it with my phone app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Our children had dropping grades and we couldn't monitor their device usage while they were away from us on the weekends. Our teen was on her phone until after 4 am at her mom's house! We installed this on her phone and the 10 yo tablet and it is the BEST APP EVER for monitoring content and availability. If your children have access to a mobile device please install this.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works well with good controls,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love it, my kids hate it. 😁 Very user friendly and easy to set up. I like the features of daily limit + additionally defining a time frame when the kids can use electronics. I also like that they can earn extra minutes with completed tasks. Finally, I got some peace of mind and don't have to police my kids if they are secretly watching or not. Just a shame it Screen time does not work in laptops.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Screentime provides well developed tools for very precisely controlling each kid's daily use. I like how kids can earn time by completing chores and how I can limit access to certain apps at certain times of day, all from my phone. Of course my kids hate it! It was pretty easy to install and set up. We did this on Nexus 7, 2nd gen tablets using restricted profiles.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Much better since the update!! My kids had been sending me completed tasks for additional screen time and I wasn't getting the emails until the next day.  The update seems to have fixed this problem.  Thanks!!,4

He also has compulsive issues with video games. He has also been able to overcome any other parental controls I have set. This is the best app for parents of techno children!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Excellent app with some great features like bedtime blocker, ""play"" ""pause"" and timer function but £29.99 PER YEAR is cost prohibitive I am sorry to say.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"App does what I want, but monthly cost is too much.  I would purchase in a heart beat if it was a one time charge of $5, $10 or even $15.  A never ending subscription is not for me",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I really love this app. I find it so helpful in physically limiting my children's screen time. Also a very helpful website and caring staff who actually get back to you if you have queries or concerns. Many thanks.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Has been a great resource for us and helps cut the arguing about too much screen time.  We have had some challenges on Apple devices, but it works like a charm on our Android devices.  Definitely worth it.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So glad we found this app. Eliminates arguments and he sees just how much time he is on his phone. Wish the ipad worked better but realize it is apple's limitations.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The best,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has helped us a ton. I like the bedtime and lights out features. I like the two way communication between our children and ourselves. While it tracks the web browser history, it does not track what they watch on the YouTube app. During the trial period I did learn to like the premium features enough to pay for the upgrade. I REALLY like the fact that the single price covers all of my children and their devices. I hope that Screen Time will develop a way to help me to track the same info on my phone",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I am a kid and I think this app is pretty good. It helps me limit my screen time. I don't like that my parents can see EVERYTHING I'm doing. You should change that.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Makes using technology a bit easier by putting in set on off times.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I installed this on my phone and the tablets our 2 kids got for Christmas.  It's really easy to use and does exactly what we need.  I'd been anxious about the kids having tablets; Screen Time helps us enforce usage limits (for particular apps).   For example, we limit the time on games, but let them access Spotify any time.   There are many nice features.  Of course, my kids don't like it!  We got the free trial (2 weeks) and then signed up for a year.   I think it's well worth the money.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Fantastic App. Just make sure you first explain to your children why they should have it. Otherwise they will get very upset.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The nights I struggled to put my kid to bed are a thing of the past thanks to this app! The ""mom video will be over in 5 minutes..."" pass bedtime, never again! This app is to say the least, a life saver, no more negotiations over tablets and bed time! I'm glad I found this app now that my son is 5 and has gotten used to the time limit, and to manage his tablet time wisely. Thank you!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Very helpful for parents who care about their kids and want to keep an eye on them. There are a lot of sick people stalking our kids. Pay attention! This app helps.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Who needs a chore chart when you have Screen Time... this is the best piece of software out there.  We are first time parents of twins, and we are just beginning to navigate this online world with them.  This makes it so much easier to pull their noses out of the devices.   Any bad reviews on here are from children, and it obviously means it is working!    We have had a great positive response from our boys.  They know if they do their tasks, Mom will gladly reward them their time.   I am soooo happy this is out there.    Thanks Screen Time!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We've much less conflict with the kids now that they have clear rules for tablet usage. The ability to set different limits for educational apps is also useful. On top of that, our boys are proactive to do jobs at home to earn extra screen time ;o)",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Gives the ability to control without hassle. Missing feature : limit time per app .,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Your kid won't like it at the beginning. But it is just impossible for parents to keep track of time usage without some kind of automation. Anyway my kid is happy now about earning minutes as reward for chores and going to bed on time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Kids hate it but thats exactly why parent should dl it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app, I'm sure it's good for those with kids. I'd personally consider using it on my own phone for discipline and sleep hygiene, but I would like ""bedtime"" to be after midnight. Arbitrarily, this is not allowed. A second issue is that I *think* this program increases the battery drain. It doesn't show terribly high on battery usage stats itself, but the consumption by ""Android processes"" seems to have increased. But it is a good program.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great.  My kids even like the request more time for doing extra tasks..,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I am happy to have this app installed on my daughter's phone. I know they don't like it because it limits what they can do. As a parent of a teen who is learning to make their own mistakes, I think it is still our responsibility to make sure they are safe while they live with us. Prevention is key these days especially in school bullying which happens so often with the use of social media. Thanks to whoever created this, we can better monitor what they do to keep them safe!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Easy to use,  worth the money!!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to use. Love that I can set up tasks and the kids earn extra time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,All useful features behind a paywall,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a parent, this is exactly what is needed to take control! Your kids are gonna hate it (and you probably) but that means it's doing what it's meant to! Buy the app, it's definitely worth it!!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Really solidly built app. My eldest was palpably relieved to have limits on her tablet and youngest enjoyed doing tasks to earn bits of extra time.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very granular control of child's device time.  Tasks to earn time is a great feature.  Only complaint is the inability to pool multiple devices under 1 child.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"PLEASE NOTE THAT THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE FROM ANGRY KIDS WHO ARE UPSET ABOUT NOT GETTING WHAT THEY WANT. SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.  As a parent of two young boys who want to play on their tablets non-stop, I consider parental control a necessity. I love my sons and I want to do all I can to ensure that they are able to have fun, but also be safe, develop socially, and learn good boundaries. With Screen Time my wife and I are able to set time limits and block apps, which many other parental control apps will do, as well as work together with our kids and avoid tablet conflicts. Screen Time has great parenting features, not just control features. When my kids run out of time, they are able to do customized chores and tasks in order to earn more time. They are safe and learning responsibility at the same time. I highly recommend this app over others that simply block and control.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a wonderful app for both parents & child. I have this installed on my 9 year old boy smartphone and it has been working wonderfully. It allowed me to realize how much time my son was spending playing and also helped him to get an overall view of the time he spends with each app. My son likes the app, he loves to get more time completing tasks and this also has helped both of us to organize better.   Customer service is SO personalized I´m amazed. Not just random messages, they actually interact with you and help solve problems with empathy and efficiency.  Great app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I am able to monitor all of my child's actions. I like that I can block certain apps and I have to approve other apps that she downloads.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Highly Recommended!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is great! It has made the struggle of how much screen time is allowed a discussion instead of a fight with my preteen and teenagers. Then the app enforces the rules. There is also flexibility built in when needed by using the play or pause features. Kids may not like it at first, but getting through the transition to this tool is worth it! Ultimately,  I now have kids that are not sleep-walking through the day because they stayed up late playing on their device and they are engaging in life again. Well done, screen time!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love it for the fact that my child can not do anything behind my back yes kids are mad because their phone gets cut off at certain points in time but you know what for the kids that read this is more important things and being on your phone all the time like going outside,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It is no free. The free features are useless. I would not recommend the app to anyone,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is perfection.  All of the negative reviews from children are written in a fit of anger, and do not reflect the true protective nature of what this app does.  I am a computer technician, and I love the way this app allows you to regulate the usage just like Windows enables you to do.  The children writing these remarks are unfortunately too young, and naïve  to even understand just what it is they are protected from.  To the other parents, let me give you a example of one reason why this works: My oldest son's phone was recently stolen.  Apparently there are still parents who do not teach their children right from wrong, and my son was a victim of the latter.  I completely locked down all apps so all of the personal information in his contact list, and text messages remained safe.  I was able to retrieve the phone, but they removed the SIM card.  I bought a new SIM card, I installed it, and rescanned the QR code.  Screen Time synced all of the Screen Time settings to the phone.  To all of the complaining children, please be more grateful.  Your parents didn't have to get you a tablet or a cell phone. Be more appreciative for what you have, not angry for what you do not.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It does what it says on the tin. Children are devious, cunning and will try anything on.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Providing a tablet or computer to our own children was a struggle because of how unrestricted the place and 'world' the Internet can be  A place where the worst and darkest or the place where the best and brightest light is.

I particularly like the school time and bed time blocking capabilities where you can block apps during school hours and bedtime.  A word of caution, this app doesn't seem to block widget usage (child can still listen to Pandora through its widget); and blocking certain Google core apps may stop Screen Time from working.",5

Had a discussion with her about why we where installing it and the greater risks around IT and internet usage.  She has no issues with it at all and actually loves the fact that she can earn additional time on the tablet through the use of the tasks option.

I will rate this 5 stars as I can control what goes on the tablet, how long they play on then and start and finish times. They might ask for more time or extension and that's where you can set tasks for time. For the money this is a bargain.

The limits and restrictions ""discussion"" and ""agreement"" happens ONCE and is settled. (Until their next ""stage"" at least.) No asking, begging, sneaking, lying, or arguments. It's already been ""agreed"" on. And unlike other ""Kid Zone"" type apps, they're not locked to 1 ""sandbox"". They can have access to anything on the device they and you want.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is great.  I wanted a way of limiting my son tablet use so that he was not on it the whole time he was at home.  This works much better than trying to keep track of it on a clock or just sensing that he has been on it too much.  The unexpected bonus is the tasks to gain more time.  It gives him a goal and a great way to teach that you reach goals by working for them.  The only downside is that there are a few too many emails.  I want emails but not necessarily so many.  Great product and the one app that I pay for.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Try it... and you will know...,5

One feature I would like is to provide is an amount of time for the weekdays and weekend and allow roll over of unused time in the weekday to the weekend but not the other way. This would allow the kids more choice over their usage and learn some time management. Thanks,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I needed something to stop my 11 yr old from spending too long staring at his tablet. He was spending a lot of time watching YouTube. I like the way you can block certain apps but not others. He has a daily limit for a number of apps but others such as Show My Homework are only restricted by the time of day. I would recommend this app and love the ability to pause their tablet if they are not listening to you!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's a fantastic app with very quick response from the team to any issues raised. Managing teenage mobile device time is now very easy! Most of the negative feedback is from teenagers who are less than impressed with it which shows how good it is. Well worth the money.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is always going to attract negative reviews because it's so good at what it does. My kids hate this app, because they've to earn their device time. Well welcome to the real world kids, you're going to be doing this when you're adults, so you might as well start now. Kudos to the developer &  kids beware, your negative reviews will not prevent the further development of this app. Can we have one for the Xbox as well please?",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome app useful for any parent,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I bought five tablets for my five children and screen time made it possible.  Of course they object.  They object to healthy food in lieu of junk food.  Resistance comes with the parenting territory.  Screen Time simple, family friendly and helps move my kids to self regulate their activity on the internet.      I highly recommend it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Screen Time is fantastic. My seven year old reads a lot and does lego robotics programming with his tablet. I love having those open to him all the time. But at the same time, I don't want him watching minecraft mod reviews at 2am.   Screen Time gives me fine-grained control over my child's media access. I talked with him before we introduced it, and he agreed that setting limits on his screentime would be a good thing to do. So I'm really happy that we can use this together collaboratively, as a team.   My son's second grade class recently had posters up - each kid mentioned what they wanted to do more of in the coming year, and what they wanted to cut down on. I was really freaked out by how many kids set a goal of ""limiting ipad time"" - it was easily the biggest thing that those kids self-identified as an issue they struggled with.   It was an issue we struggled with, before we subscribed with Screen Time.   All that's missing now is platforms. I really hope that Nintendo and Microsoft can jump aboard in the coming years. It's the only flaw I've found - if he can find a device without Screen Time installed, all our best intentions go out the window.",5

I could see he was on his phone until almost 4am. (I had not upgraded yet). My only reason for not giving 5 stars is because I haven't been able to download it on the Kindles yet and when in use on iPhone or iPad, the boys can ""close it out"" shutting off the monitoring. On the Samsung phone it runs consistantly and tracks everything. .",4

I homeschool so I like being able to let them use their tablets during school time with only selected apps.  I would like a feature that requires them to do a minimum time of educational before other games but i just handle it myself.  Also like the daily permitted time.  I looked at all of them out there and this one is best.  Great app!!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a father of a nine year old girl I have to say this is a great app to ensure kids don't spend too much time on their devices.  My daughter was frustrated at first, but when she realized that she could easily add an hour or more of screen time to her device every day by doing her chores and homework it became second nature to her.  She now gets things done without being asked over and over and also gets a lot of time to play on her device.  It's a win win!",5

The kids hate it, but without it they were on their tablet more than they were sleeping! We've had issues with the app but the response was timely and fixed the problems. This app allows parents to enforce the limits they tell the kids (like lights out, daily limits, and block apps that you don't want them to have).",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a must have app if you have kids. Lock down their device and have control over what they access and for how long.  Kids want more time? No problem!

If the kids hate it, that just means it works. :-) Parents need to have a way to stay on top of things, especially with all the bad apps out there now-a-days (i.e. the 'calculator' app that is being used to hide inappropriate pictures).  I would love to have something similar for the laptop. That would make it even more awesome.

My son can be sat next to me but it will say he's not been on it for 3 days but perfect on note 3. I am finding I am requiring it less after a month because he is learning to accept the basic principle of what it does and now does chores 1st. The bedtime blocker is the best.

When I asked for help I received it quickly.   I really wish I could use this on a pc. And I saw where one reviewer is using it on her own phone. I need to check that out. I could use some self-monitoring.  I have great kids who just needed a little help managing time spent on their phones. We started by just installing it. I monitored their use (love the daily email summaries!) and decided if restrictions were needed and where. I was pleased in some ways and not so pleased in others. This let me see where they need help and set limits there.   One of my kids didn't believe it was really that secure and tried to hack into it. He learned right away that even trying locks him out of his phone completely. He had to come to me to get use of it again.

The only bad reviews you will see on this app are from brats that don't like their parents having control. I can pause the usage of his phone until he does his chores. How awesome is that!?!?!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Not free- two week trial. It does not work and not it wont even uninstall.  I tried support and they take 2 days to respond with canned email. Child spent 4 hrs on YouTube in the middle of the night.  Worthless- from a parent DO NOT DOWNLOAD! WILL NOT UNINSTALL!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This gets 5 stars from me as a parent. It offers really incredible, fine-grained control over my kids' tablets. The fact that some kids go out of their way to give this negative reviews should be worth a sixth star.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is great at controlling my son's access to individual apps. Aside from that, it is pretty useless. The most disappointing issue is that I had it set for my son to be able to use his phone for one hour a day.

If your phone has qslide though, your kids can do work arounds to access other things when they shouldnt....had to get different phones because of that. Only other thing I wish it had was a key logger for text msgs",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Did a near perfect job controlling both kids' screen time and what they can do. Lots of options and tweaks for fine tuning. Especially like the feature on Android where apps can be individually selected and limited.  However, I didn't give 5-star because some apps are constantly excluded from time limit after I set them to be included in time limit. For example, YouTube, and a couple of other games. I know my kids didn't steal my password to exclude them on their own. So if this bug can be fixed, it would earn 5-star from me.",4

Location services is disabled on all of their devices and program works perfectly.   After a few weeks, I opted to pay for the yearly service because the upgrades are so handy.

Limits are clear and you have a wide view of the device usage. You can be selective to block games and video streaming apps after a while and let the child use mind and educational apps instead. Privacy is guaranteed by blocking social networks and even Playstore and Settings. You can reward completed tasks with extra time. You have full control of the device, it keeps the last configuration while offline, even if the device is rebooted. I use it combined with ""Smart Launcher"" that lets me hide permanently blocked apps and avoid frustration. The anual fee is nothing compared to the benefits you get.",5

Managing my boys tablets and phones has been a snap since I installed it.  Simple and effective and I can't believe how they comply with the time limits and hour restrictions.  Life is so much easier.  They constantly try to get bonus time by asking for more chores or rewards.  I'm also very impressed how they haven't been able to ""game the system"".  Believe me, they have tried.  I also especially like that I can immediately reward or punish the boys by adding time or ""pausing"" play for some amount of time on all devices at once.  I also have tried other poor implementations, like Amazon and kids mode.  Those are complete junk compared to this.",5

So, I moved my kids over to Nexus 7's, and tried several apps to monitor their usage. We LOVE this one. It (a) Lets us monitor our kids * from our own phones * (b) Sends daily summaries via email (c) Lets you set bedtimes (d) Lets you set apps (like Kindle) to not count toward daily limits  ... We use restricted profiles (instead of Screen Time) on the tablets to control which apps our kids have access to. You don't have to, but our kids are small enough that I don't want to let them get into things like the Play Store and Settings.  My only criticism is if you use restricted profiles, it isn't clear how to set up the Screen Time client app to tell the difference between the parent and the child. So, I get emails every time I install an app on my kids devices, and I get daily summaries that include my own activity on the device.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I think this app is great because you can control how long your child can play games instead of them also using it to read or find out things for their home work. It keeps them safe from going into things they shouldn't be and stop accidental charges. It's also encourages them to spend time as a family instead of them trying to sit on gadgets all the time even after you have told them to come off. They have chances to earn extra time which gives them responsibility to help you out more.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love the app, especially on Android. Tons of great features. Allows me, as a parent, to pick and choose which apps I want to block, for how long and when. Gives me TONS of control over my kids' phones.  For Iphones, not as great, but still more control than any other parental monitoring device we have found. This is not Screen Time's fault, it is the way Apple runs the software and what they do and don't allow their apps to do. In the future, we won't be allowing any of our kids to have Iphones for this very reason. There are tons of great Android phones out there and Screen Time will be installed on every single one of them. I even have it on my phone (parent) to let me know how much time I've been on my phone. I don't have any time limits or restrictions set, so I can do whatever I need to, but I like the ability to see how much time I've spent on my phone each day and how long on each app.  Don't believe the negative reviews. They are most likely written by frustrated kids. Seriously, this app is the gold standard by which we judge other parental control apps. We left Screen Time for some other apps which we thought would be better, but came back after only a few months becaus",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It's a Game Changer in parent child relationships over tablets and phones!  It is not a fully mature app but what is there is pretty good -- it does all the basics correctly.  Little stuff like finding your way initially on the screen and child and parent  understanding doesn't always perfectly match up.  These are small compared to my son getting to spend 6 hours playing on his tablet when he should be doing other stuff.  The app puts the parent in charge in a way that can get the child the screen time they are allowed in a flexible way.  Children resent the intrusion when they discover just how effective it is.    My biggest wish though, is that it take over the computer and our new Nvidia Shield (android) TV.   If it could do that, then I'd see in one spot *all* of the screen time my child was gettting.  Even so, this app is the first giant leap for parent-kind.  So, it gets 5 stars.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I'm giving two stars instead of one because the app has potential and I liked having access from my computer.   The reason I am not giving more stars is because I can't make any changes to my preferences unless I upgrade.  I feel like they falsely advertise a free app then after a few days require you pay in order to continue to use.  They should advise that it's a free trial and purchase will be necessary.    They also had the nerve to send me a message to rate their app 5 stars just because they had received a whole bunch of bad reviews.  I would have been happy to review it if they had asked me to share my experience but their approach seemed shady.  The 4.0 star rating is bloated and there are integrity issues behind the scenes.   Also, There are plenty of bugs that need to be worked out.  It will sometimes lock me out of everything for no reason and it's impossible to make it work correctly sometimes.  It's fine for my kids tablets because they don't have to have access for important work but I wouldn't put it on my own phone because it doesn't always work correctly and it's too risky that I might needed my phone for business.",2

I knew some other apps can even track the text messages or seeing photos your kids have uploaded on their social media.My daughter is a very sensible kid so all l wanted is something can help her manage time better. with this app, l have peace of mind that she doesn't stay up late .l can pause the phone when it's time to do homework and unpause it as soon as she finishes.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Don't believe the bad reviews. They're all from kids who are just angry that it works so well. I use this for my four kids and it works exactly as you'd hope.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"They charge for some of the services that used to be free, but the price is reasonable and I paid without hesitation.  I haven't found another app that gives a parent total control over their kids devices like this one does.  Allowing the kids to do extra tasks for extra time is fabulous.  Making sure they are safe and using their devices appropriately is priceless.  I tell all of my friends to get this app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app does everything it says it is incredibly usefull!!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Needs some refinement, but it works quite well and is less intrusive than a custom shell.  Perhaps a tad pricy as well but obviously not prohibitively so.  Customer support is responsive.  The ability to pause their device access from my phone or computer is great. Recommended",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,App won't even start,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This has to be the worst parental control app out there. Don't waste your time. The bedtime blocker has to be the worst feature of the whole app. It blocks you out of your phone even outside of the time restrictions.  Worst app ever.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,bad app no work kid use phone still a lot,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good for limiting kids time at the screen. Doesn't always give them extensions when applied though.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We purchased this app following a recommendation from friends. It is excellent. It would have higher star rating were it not for kids who don't like it! As a parent of teenage kids this is a great tool that allows us to have conversations with them about how much time they spend on line on games and what they are using the Internet for. The company are very quick to respond and my only wish is that this would be available for computers as well!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Getting better all the time and support is excellent. Will give it 5 stars when features such as different bedtime for different days etc. are available.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Our family loves this application...especially myself and my husband. Our children don't always realize we do things because we love them and want to protect them.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great App!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,In this day of technology where everyone has instant access as a parent its a great app. No longer is there any debate about how much time is left or when they can be used. Sinse the initial shock its largely been a success. Good deeds can be rewarded but equally time can be removed or paused for misbehaving etc.  The ability to limit certain apps and monitor useage is something that we have all been needing for a while.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love that i can make changes instantly on my phone. This helps me monitor my child's usage and keeps them accountable by earning time through chores.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"A useful tool for parents to reduce the time your child spentds on devices, block apps, set bedtime, School time, monitor activity and set rewards for good behaviour. A great tool but you need to take the time to explain why to your children. With more functionality, perhaps blending it with bitdefender and this would be an awesome app.",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My daughter hates this app, but I love it on Android. It doesn't rearrange my kid's icons like the apple OS type apps. We love it so much we got premium and are replacing her school iPad with an Android tablet.  It works as promised. I can give her more screen time for doing her chores, see what apps are consuming her time, see browser history, and even say ""come downstairs for dinner"". We (parents) love it. Teen hates it. We have even taken off daily limits to see how she uses her device and screen time gives us data to discuss with her.   I know the company is working to improve their new iOS app, but we will stick with the amazing Android version for now.",5

Now all is easy Goods: Time restriction per day and weekends  Multiple slots in a day for e.g school time and bed time  Allows which app to block or not to  Can keep track of what they use and for how long  Bads: Cannot restrict individual app wrt time  Cannot block websites ( i believe they are working in it)",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app! Have recommended it to friends and family whenever I hear people complain about their zombie kids on their devices all day. This solved a huge problem for me. Sure, I could tell the kids to get off their tablets after a certain amount of time (if I remembered), but this app somehow takes the fight out of it. Tablet stops working because of Screen Time, kids put it down. Mom says ""get off the tablet"", kids whine and cry about it. It's so TOTALLY worth the money, I love it!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My kids hate it which tells me it's working great!  It used to be they would sneak their tablets to bed or go hide.

With the latest updates the free version no longer meets my needs.  The cost of the Premium services is not worth it to me. I'm uninstalling it.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My wife an i love this app for our kids. We have total control over their 'screen time'. Plus it has tons of other cool features to help you be a bit more proactive with your children's device use.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very user friendly and have recommended it often.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Perfect for parents that value time and know that children are going to test boundaries. Screen time allows us to not only monitor the activity but makes sure they kids aren't sneaking time after lights out or up early to get some game time.  I work ft and school ft so this app is perfect for us.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We started using this app to set limits on the amount of time our kids could use their tablets each day. It also allowed us to give them extra time as ""rewards"" when we deemed appropriate.  We were straight forward with our expectations & it has worked out GREAT for our family!  It gives us ultimate control over their devices!  Plus we get daily email summaries of their usage...love it!!  Highly recommend :-)",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works well helps keep my kids screen time in check. They know they can get more time by doing chores. I give them a set time for weeknights and a set time for weekends. Helps keep their faces out of their tablets and see the world around them.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is a fantastic way to control your kids' devices and ensure they aren't using devices that you put in timeout, or using them at times of day that are off limits. I love being able to send pauses to their devices when they aren't doing what they've been asked to do, or sending more time when they have earned it by doing a chore. It's super easy to use from my phone or tablet. Thumbs up from the parents!!",5

But no more arguments as kids have accepted it and have got used to managing thier time. Being able to control thier useage via the app on my phone is great.  I really  would recommend this app to any parent and have done to all my mates, even helping some of them set it up on thier kids devices.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app to let me limit my kids from being on their screens 24/7. Good parental controls lets me see an overview of what my kids are up to online and a great realization of just how much time they spend on certain apps.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I have been using Android devices and iPads for many years and had never paid a single cent for any apps. This is the only apps that I paid the subscription fees!  It doesn't solve all the issues I have with my 3 children. But it prevents them from excessive use of their mobile phones or tablets without me resorting to confiscate the devices. Apps works very well on Android devices but lack features for iPad.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've only been using this for a short while, but it's amazing. The response for any question is almost immediate from tech support; the kids are offering help and completing every task to earn more time; they are not monsters when their time is up; and I'm not the bad guy for putting these limitations on tech time, but I'm still a responsible parent that ensures their tasks are done correctly. I took it a step further and told the kids that Santa installed the app..... Wow! Wow! Wow! Genius idea!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,ScreenTime by Screen Time Labs is the best screen time monitoring app I have ever used.  My family has been using this app for over a year and my only complaint is that I can't install it on my home computer.  I have 5 children and they all have their own devices ranging from phones to tablets and this app makes it so easy to set screen time allowances and monitor how my children use their devices and all their devices work seamlessly.  I would recommend to any parent with kids who have their own devices.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is well thought out and has a lot of functionality.  Our son really resented the app at first. Because of this program's enforcement of his tablet time,  he has to live by some clear rules. I love the way we can change his access remotely, from our smartphones, even rewarding good behavior with more time. Thank you for helping us enforce some healthier time and usage controls.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I would recommend this to any parent looking for a way to be aware of what their kids are doing and be able to control access to certain sites or limit screen time.  I'm thankful to have this app to help me safeguard my children.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So easy to bypass,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The fact that so many kids have left negative feedback is a testimony to how effective this program is. Kids can't beat it and it drives then crazy. Right now I only have a 7 year old and a 5 year old so I mostly use the daily limit on usage and the bedtime timers. So they don't hate me yet but soon they will want to go faster I to the world then they should and I will be glad to have this app.,5

I hope to be able to keep using this app to protect my daughter from harmful content and be a good influence on her decision making. Love this app!!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Naturally kids hate limitations no matter how good these are. I have switched from Parental Board to Screen Time. Overall it is the much better up. Especially setting a common policy for all devices for a certain kid is very helpful. Only thing missing is to limit certain webpages. I do understand this is difficult to implement but maybe this will come in the future,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I use it to monitor reading time. Kids can play games only after reading treshold is met. Very effective in giving them the appetite to read.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My daughter deleted the app after a day and used it as she wanted.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app was purchased by a larger company and they made all content premium. You cant use it without paying $4 a month. Greed ruined a good app.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. By far the best I've seen or there. The developers have put a lot of thought into this program ands it continues to get better. I have the remote on my galaxy s5 and my children all have various android based tabs and it seem to work fine. They have worked out the earlier kinks. I am a police detective and I always suggest this app to parents who come to me asking for a good watchdog app. My kids dislike it but as a parent I love it. It has reduced any argument over devices to nil.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love the great control over which apps are blocked for which times (school, bedtime etc.) and the 'reward time' works really well. The only downsides are a slightly clunky web interface for the parent (as I don't have an android device myself) and the lack of a way of adding one-off time to your child's daily allowance without them requesting it. Oh, and the iOS version lacks any of the fine app-by-app control that makes this so good (but I gather that is an universal Apple issue). All in all, I would strongly recommend Screen Time, especially to those who want to allow their kids 'good' app use whilst limiting gaming, or to anyone who finds it hard to get their kids off screen!",4

Loved it immediately, and so much that was disappointed that it wasn't available for iOS. As of the past week it is now available for iOS. This is not a big brother is watching app, but a great tool to work with your kids to manage their use of electronic devices. Has a cool feature that allows them to earn more time that it is fully customizeable to the things you want to encourage your kids to be doing around home and in their lives. It is getting a few bad reviews from the kids because lets face it, they were out of control and now we have a tool that helps reign in the behaviour. Keep on developing!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Best Screen time management app out there.  Works well, with a good variety of features.   It may take some time to set up or understand all the features, but it's worth it.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app puts parents back in control of their kids smart phone and tablet usage.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. I no longer have to wrestle the tablet off of my son. Click the button on my phone and he is locked out! When I am ready he can go back on. He can have a set time each day and I can view his activity remotely and have a summery emailed to me. I love this app (he is not so keen but knows and respects that he will be rewarded for good behavior and sensible attitude towards his leisure time activities).,5

She has a samsung tablet and I control it from my Note 3 or login over the web. We have chores setup and control her usages times and applications. Works perfect. Well worth it. Her 10yr old sister is now learning responsibility for tablet usage with screentime and he 8yr old sister knows that when she gets a tablet it just part of the deal.,5

I agree, kids hate it and parents love it.  - Because we love our kids and know they need limits and boundaries.",5

I'm not on her case to get off the phone.  I'm not the ""bad guy""  I don't have to stress about how long she's on the phone or tablet.  When the time is up, it's up.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My wife and I started using the free version of this app, but quickly decided to upgrade to the premium version. We have not regretted it. Our kids hate it, but that is a good thing. It allows us to monitor what they are doing, downloading, viewing, and more. We can limit how many minutes a day they access their devices, and we can grant more time if they complete tasks, or we can remotely block them if needed. We love this app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app.  I don't have to stress anymore about him being on the phone too late or my younger child accessing inappropriate content.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,**Updated review  After 2 years of using this app and trying to find alternatives I have given up it is hands down the best one on the market no point looking for an alternative this is by far the best.  I had a problem with the monthly payment and using google pay which have been fixed. No complaints it just works and is light on your system.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Since downloading this I feel like I have better control of my children and their mobiles. Rewarding them is as easy as removing it from them. Great to keep an eye on what they are going on and how much time they are spending on different apps. The bedtime blocker has been a godsend. No longer are my children secretly up until all hours on their phones. They now have a set time when everything on their mobile shuts down. All except for their alarms for when they get up. Fab app..affordable!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Terrible,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Pros:   1) Encourages positive rewards rather than being a fence around your kids.  Similarly, it encourages positive negotiation rather than just being a strict barrier that the kinds wind up being angry at.  2) You can have one group of apps (e.g.: those required for homework like Google Docs) available all the time except for bedtime, and another group of apps (e.g.: games and recreation) that are time-limited.  3) You can turn off all limits for a period of time, e.g.: on a long ride.  Similarly, you can pause access to everything on the device for a period of time (e.g.: dinner time)--independently from the other features.  4) Web site access logging encourages discussion about what is safe/not.  5) The parents' phone app for approving tasks and rewarding screen time on the go.   Cons:  1) The current version has some bugs where my kids' devices timed out before they had used all of their time.  This seemed to happen when I used the ""play"" feature to temporarily remove limits and then later they finished tasks to earn more screen time.  2) No web filtering for younger kids.   Verdict:  Excellent for teens & responsible tweens.  I bought the app.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app makes it very easy to control the amount of time my children spend on their tablet while also providing incentive for them help around the house.  Have used it for a year or so.  The developer is always quick to respond and correct bugs.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"accurate and helpful, does what it is supposed to do",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This isn't the kind of app that I imagine paying $40 a year for. They've been gradually stripping out the features in the free version and making them premium. Make a light version with just the following features: one device only, daily limit, and bedtime blocker, and charge a one time fee of $10. Then we have a deal.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Amazing app, good features, decent value for money... I'm able to control 2 tablets and the 2 phones",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This application controls which applications are available for the children to use.  It has full flexibility to pick applications to control on which days and for how long.  However, this is a great teaching tool.  Yes, it controls applications but, in that way, it is simply ""enforced self-discipline"".  I have set the limit at six hours and asked my children to keep to a limit one hour limit.  If they stay within the one hour, the limit stays at six.  If miss the one hour limit, I move the limit down to one hour.    With the limit set at one hour, the applications stop right on time.  If they need an extra couple of minutes to finish their game, I allow that.  The children soon learn that finishing at 62 minutes is far better than being forced to stop at exactly 60 minutes.    It took my two about a week to work it out.  I had to monitor each night and reset limits where necessary.  But now I only need to look at it once per week.    And my children are better for it!",5

Yes, they sometimes wish they had more time, but we have set up plenty of tasks to help them earn more time if they want it.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Update:1-3-16 the price has risen and the app has gotten a little better with more control remotely but not $3.99 per month worth. Thankfully I locked in the $2.99 with a 1 year subscription. The app on Iphone doesn't do much at all. Almost non existent.  I paid for a 1 year subscription but this may be my last.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app for parents but kids won't like it because it keeps them from getting into apps and areas that they are not allowed in so they would give it a bad review.

He created accounts on Facebook, Snap Chat, etc. and other places and was getting bullied.  We stopped all that with Screen Time.",5

I also like the fact that the parents need to release new apps after the kids install them. I don't like the idea that they might use whatever app or game they fancy to download.  There is still some scope for improvement (for example, it would be good if one could create application groups with different time limits) but this is already the best parental control application on the market, in my opinion (and I tried quite a few).  Last but not least, the developers are quite responsive and when I had some trouble they answered very quickly and managed to solve the issue very efficiently.",5

I believe most negative reviews are from kids who can no longer do whatever they want on their tablets and phones due to Screentime.

Not only does it allow you to control the amount of time your child spends on their devices, but it also allow granular control of what apps can be used, and when.

You cannot create a daily schedules like Monday/Wednesday/Friday = 2 hours, other days zero. Current calendar has only weekdays and weekends. 2.

This isn't a set-it-forget-it app, because my kids are heavy users and putting new stuff on all the time.  It takes a bit of management, but so does parenting.

You know it is a good app when my kids hear me telling other parents about it and they both reply that they hate it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I'd give 5 stars if this app worked on IOS ie Google Chrome.  This is a great app and is very helpful because I can stay on top of the kids as I'm busy with work.  This way I can be sure they're learning to prioritize their responsibilities vs play. It has taken me some time to revamp settings in order to get it to work according to our household but after a while we've worked it out.  Of course the kids don't like it...tough.,4

They do extra chores or good deeds, then send me a request and picture. My husband is also linked on the account so even when he's away he's able to make changes right from his phone.

I like how the kids app is free and if you want to access and edit your kids app remotely they give an option to pay monthly, every six months, or once a year.

The ability to block apps used to be part of the basic package, but now it's only available with the monthly subscription. Now it's useless unless you pay.

If you want to limit usage to stop at bedtimes and amount of time on certain apps like YouTube.

They would definitely prefer a free-for-all approach.  But that is not happening...  If the app were free, it would earn 5 stars from me.",4

Now that we have screen time again my kids are playing like normal kids. It also tells me how they are spending their tablet time. Peace of mind!!! This app allows you to shut them down at bed time, monitor their app usage, limit their time on certain apps but allow unlimited time on other apps. Monitor multiple children. You also get email alerts when someone has successfully entered the parents password to indicate the system may be hacked by your kid. My kids hate this app!!! 😆",5

They get 30 minutes gifted time per day and earn the rest by doing basic stuff like brushing teeth without being told. They get annoyed sometimes because the want more time, but...they have to earn it. :)",5

It also works when I am busy doing house stuff and I allow our 10 year old to use her phone an extra 10 mins or so before bed. I never forget to shut it down while I'm preoccupied with dishes because the app will do it for me automatically. This app also works for positive reinforcement- when a child does something good at home/school. You can reward them by giving them extra screen time. LOVE IT!,5

We have tried achieving this with monetary allowance in the past but realized she is not driven by dollar bills like she is minutes of tablet time. Sad but true.

As far as all those kids go, who post here that they ""hate"" the app. That should tell you that the app is working!

Also I would like to have two groups of duration limited apps. For me, one group would have a 1/2 hour per day time limit, and the other group would have a 2 hour time limit, as some apps I want to severely limit while others I permit more of, but still not during all free time.

It has many AMAZING features but I have two which are my favorite. 1. You can pause your child's with just a push of a button from you cell phone. Say you actually want to have a nice dinner with your family with everyone engaged, just pause your child's phone! It's awesome. 2.You can set time limits are certain apps at even certain times! For example, if I do not want my daughter playing Candy Crush all day at school, I just limit the time for that app during the school day or even block if I want. So I have control of her time spent on Candy Crush, but she can still use her phone!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My parents use screentime with me I dislike it but it teaches how to even your time out and its a great app for all ages,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This program is very useful. It is well worth the money. It helps us monitor programs and amount of time the kids use their tabs. Thank you for a great program.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Screentime is wonderful! I have control over my son's phone and what he does or doesn't do on it without being on him constantly.  He knows the limits, once they are reached screentime  is the bad guy. He can earn extra time if I allow it. I do all of this from my phone, and I can also see what websites my son is visiting.  My son is 10, and of course he despises Screentime! He has tried to disable it, get the password, and even told me he thought about doing a factory reset on his phone!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This stinks,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We have 3 teens/preteens and keeping track of how much time they were spending on all of their devices was impossible. This app allows us to set the limits and then go about our day and not worry about it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great App, allows me to control my children's tablet usage and monitor App downloads.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is the best thing ever! My teenager used to be at night time using his phone and I blocked it. He then found a loophole in the program but with the quick communication I got back from Oliver we were able to work together and resolve the issue.  Great customer experience,  great app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The 1 star reviews are from frustrated kids.  Trust me...GREAT APP for parents.  Better than taking their phone away.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Amazing app! Changed the way we use tech in our home!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Was a brilliant  app until they made all the features  'premium'  which you have to pay for!  Free app but u have to pay for any useful  features.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good for my granddaughter.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Definitely helps me make sure my kids don't spend too much time on their devices. Plus I can monitor what they are watching and searching which gives me some peace of mind. Thanks screen time. Now I just need it to work on Windows.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I'm a father of 3 boys [11-16 yrs old] This app is awesome. It's really simple to set up, and has a really straightforward interface. I recommend paying for the premium. It's a great way of helping your tween/teen be accountable for how they behave online, and a great way of keeping them safe and being able to see how long they are spending on their phone/internet/games/etc and at what time they are using it. You can limit time  and even block apps at certain times - like when they are in school. The app is as restrictive as you want it to be - you can have apps fully blocked, or leave everything open and just use it to monitor how they are using their device. It saves arguments that would start with ""Let me see your phone, I want to check it!"" and lowers the conflict to conversations that go more like ""I don't think you should be on your phone at 2am - you should be sleeping."" It's really wonderful. You must have the conversation with your child about how it is only there to help you do your job, as their parent, of keeping them safe, while they learn how to use their device wisely.    I think that most of the 1 & 2 stars are from kids who REALLY don't like this app.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a fantastic app for monitoring and controlling children's screen time in today's world of excessive mobile device usage. Screen Time offers an extensive list of features and is continually expanding on this. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that all useful features are locked behind a subscription service. This is understandable, but slightly overpriced, IMO.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Been paying for this for two years now for my son's tablet. Allows me complete control over everything he does on his tablet and now his phone.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"So helpful! This is exactly what I have been looking for to manage all of my four kids' screen time. I talked to my teen about it beforehand and we mutually agreed that it was a good idea. He agreed that having unlimited time on his phone was causing him to miss out on other things like playing outside.  I think having him 'on board' with the idea, helped him be okay with having limits.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it. We used Screen Time the moment our kids got their own devices. Everyone was in the know from the get-go. No arguments. This makes life so much easier.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I looked at other apps for monitoring and regulating my kids time on their devices. Screen Time was the best solution for me. It allows me to regulate when and how long they use their devices and gives me the option of assigning tasks that allow them to earn extra time. The pricing model that allows me to pay one fee for all my childrens' devices was also a key point in my decision.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My daughter is young for a phone (10), but for safety reasons we wanted her to have one.  This app has allowed us to have peace of mind that she would be using the phone appropriately and not staying up late on gaming apps.  This is much more user friendly than Verizon family base.  We can block certain apps but leave others, so she can still read on her phone or listen to music even at times we wouldn't want her playing games...",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I really enjoy being able to see what my daughter is doing and having the ability to set tasks and see which apps she is downloading. It encourages us to have discussions and set limits on some of her electronic options to encourage real play and education.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great App. I wish it were cheaper. Based on the parental apps that are available to androids this is the best I have used. I used this for my daughter's phone when she was 12 and 13 yrs. I am able to unlock apps and lock apps from my phone or any device that has access to the internet. I saved my password and create a bookmark on my phone so with one touch I am in. I can also see which apps she is using daily and the percentage of time spent on that app. I receive dialing emails with this information as well. So far it's been great.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Ignore the low start ratings given by kids!!! This app is the best app out there at the moment, the parental controls on all tablets and phones are Inadequate which means your child can view content containing, sex, drugs, violence which isn't appropriate for their age. This app lets you control how long and when your child can access their device, you can also choose what apps they have access to. You get notified of any changes made to the device, and can control their access from your mobile or laptop.  Its a must have if you have children.  Still waiting for the iPhone app................",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"First of all, any kids rating this as 1 star is a good thing because it means this app is working as intended. If it's not making them mad, then it doesn't work properly.  From my end of things (as a parent) this is a lifesaver. I've been able to control much more infinitely what kind of content my kids are exposed to and limit their time ensuring they have a good day and grow up healthy and not addicted to their electronics like so many kids.  This app is indispensable. Period.",5

I like the feature where I can limit what they can do after a certain time. Love the bedtime shut off. I also love that I can block the internet and YouTube.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I loved this app to help me control how much time my kids spent on their tablet.  I did not care about remote control or blocking the tablet/apps.  I installed only for the time limit which I have to pay for.  Why the change?  I understand that you are doing this on your time and we all deserve to be payed for our time. But why the change?  May have to start looking for  another app.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Sneakily changed it to required a VERY expensive subscription to set a daily limit, which was previously free since it's inception.  I was wondering why my kids had been on their tablets so long the last few days. Uninstalling and looking for other options.

I told them the issue and asked how to uninstall the program. They sent a  response that just said to install from Google. I can not re-download from anywhere because I need to first uninstall the program. I can not uninstall the program because it requires me to put in the password. I can not put in the password because I can not launch the program. Every time I try to launch the program, it immediately crashes. When I responded that she needed to actually read the issue, I was told to launch in safe mode and remove the program (FYI: to prevent kids from uninstalling the program the app is designed not to allow this. Again, CS does not know its own software) or do a full Factory reset... so I get to now loose all of my data and spend time setting my tablet back up because they did not preform proper testing to begin with.

If u child smart they can mute the phone so you can't hear it ring and prior to phone going off tell their friends to call them.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this! In a funny way, I am impressed with the youth and their ability to think through rating this app poorly to persuade patents not to download it lol.  We are liking the app and feel better about the kids using personal computing devices.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This has ended the constant battles we had over how much time the children were spending on their devices- I particularly love the play/pause feature (no more endless yelling up the stairs at mealtimes!); updates when they have installed new apps and being able to reward them with extra time for good behaviour/homework completed etc. The kids (esp ds!) have been annoyed by it but frankly their health, safety education and wellbeing are more important to me! Definitely worth the money.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The app works as described. It is taking a bit of getting used to from both sides. The biggest thing is helping him understand there is time management sills in life that are extremely valuable. This certainly helps. Thank you - Great app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best parental control app. And awesome service,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Several tries. Cannot use it yet.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a great app. Lets you control how much time your child/children are spending on phone/tablet, what apps they can use and at what times. The pause button is a great facility as is the school time. I no longer have to keep telling my son to turn the phone off and put his shoes on for school as I have screentime set up to switch off 5 minutes beforehand. I cannot recommend this product enough. It also encourages your child to do tasks/jobs/chores, whatever you want to call them, so they can earn bonus time. Fantastic!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works really well, fortunate to have installed it while my children are young as I can see by some of the low feedback that older kids really resent it! I have given them a daily restriction on games but educational apps are not restricted. It is teaching them to plan and schedule their time and keeping them to a reasonable limit. A really practical approach to a modern parenting problem.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I am usually hesitant on spending any money on apps, but after trialling the premium features of this app i have now committed  £2.99 a month for those features. I can honestly not think of anything better, best £2.99 I could ever spend. I absolutely love this app! Thank you screen time for making our lives so much more manageable!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I  enjoy this app because it can quickly be that assistance that we as parents need to limit the amount of time our children are on their tablets. The coolest feature is ""Pause"" where you send a message to them when they haven't listened to your calls for dinner. I'm sure kids hate this, but as a parent it's the best.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love that I can control the apps that my kids have available, look at the app logs to see what time of the day they were using their apps, lock their phone on command.  It has made my children frustrated because I have complete control over their phone. Lol. Love it and highly recommended",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Stinks,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I used the free version for about 6 mths and decided to go ahead and go premium.  It prevents many arguments and gives me the control over what and when my daughter is on her tablet.  Love that she can earn more time with chores!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Liked the functionality so well subscribed for six months. This isn't being used as punishment, just some time limit control. It's 70 outside and we got tired of watching healthy kids sitting around watching videos. Our son is enjoying it and adjusting to the limitations.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It sucks #resonsable already,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's a great app. Rewarding tasks with screen time has motived our kids a lot. Best to get it on the kids devices when they first get them to avoid resentment from the kids later on. Can be slow and email messages seem to arrive at odd times.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great product, great support",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The worst app ever,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Easy way to manage your child's phone. Very flexible and configurable. Set daily limits, specify which apps can still be accessed after the limits are hit, set night time access apps, etc.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is exactly what we needed w/ our two girls. It allowed us to set limits on their screen times w/o arguing, to manage the sites they went to, the apps they installed and helped decrease time on phones overall. I absolutely LOVE the pause button for when one of them doesn't come to dinner or another activity when called. It also solved the problem of letting them take their phones to bed for music, by using the bedtime/lights out feature I can control what apps are available to them. Excellent app!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My son doesn't have his own device, so I could never make a profile. I just wanted a timer for my tablet so I am not the bad guy. This app is way complicated and not what I thought.",3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Take control back of your teenagers. Helped us regain control of our out of control kids.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love the control it gives me. It takes the pressure off of me to constantly hover over their tablet use and they know the clear boundaries and limits we've set in place. Before we had this app we were constantly having to say no to time on the tablet or no to what they could use resulting in whining and arguing. Problem solved with this app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I don't know where to start. This is the best app we've found to date. In fact, many of my iPad-friends want this app for their kids. [Hint. Hint.] Since installing this on my son's tablet, we talk more about the apps and games he plays, he loves earning more time by doing tasks, and it has virtually eliminated arguments and misunderstandings. In fact, we give our son the option to either earn more screen time or money for chores. He is much more responsible and we discuss his screentime options a lot more.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Worth the investment for pro. Gives the kids enough screen time then they have to stop. Remote access is worth it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"THIS is the app you need if your children use tech like phones and tablets, gives great control over usage and fantastic for bedtime as the app can be set up to deny access at a set time.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,RUBBISH!!!!! :-( :-( :-( :-( :-( :-( :-(,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great.  Love the remote control and ability to enable apps my son wants remotely.  The best app out there with a good balance of control without being overly invasive,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Best qpp. 10/10 all day, everyday.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"LOVE having the ability to ""pause"" our kids when they are on tablet or phone with message such as ""dinner is ready"".. sure beats the yelling upstairs!  Love setting reasonable limits, that we discussed as a family, and our kids had input on what that limit should be...  of course extra time can be earned, and we also agreed on various chores/tasks they can complete in order to gain more time.   The app just makes it easier to have the discussion with our kids as opposed to just saying ""ok, you spent enough time on the tablet"" which leads to begging/bargaining!  :)  Support team is very responsive, and features are improved and added often.  I can see this app being viewed as punitive by kids IF parents don't have a discussion on WHY it is being set up, as well as including them in setting limits.  Great job!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app.  Stopped the fighting over the phone in its tracks.   I would like to see two things to make it perfect:  1) to be able to approve a task and designate the extra time for the next day, not the same day; and 2) compatibility with the iPhone",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"A solid app, with well thought out tools to help (multiple) parents manage/block apps & manage/pause/restart screentime. I was really impressed with their customizable TASKS, allowing (multiple) children to earn extra minutes for performing tasks (i.e. chores, acts of kindness, homework, etc) by selecting the task completed from their device which notifies parents who can review & approve them from their devices. Plus, after the trial version, I felt the premium annual fee was well worth it! And I'm glad!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app and the website work pretty well. I subscribed to Premium, because it's worth it to have the transparency and control over my kid's device usage. When it comes to smart phones and kids, this is the kind of app parents need.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My little darlings now have their tablet addictions under control. I'm a tech head but I know when to turn it off. Kids don't. Really like the bonus time for completed tasks. Strangely so does my eldest who sees it as a challenge!,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We use this to limit our 10 year old's phone access to YouTube and to restrict her usage while at school. The settings and control take a little trial and error, but after, we realized them to be pretty easy and intuitive. We're able to increase privileges and screentime based on custom tasks as well as approve those that our child as accomplished. All, without invading our child's space or privacy and having mutual respect for technology and each other. Recommended!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app. Great way to limit kids' time on devices as part of a total strategy of you being very involved in what they're watching or playing,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I find it difficult to see just how good this app is when I cannot block apps or set timers. I will not be purchasing something that I cannot really try out.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has proved incredibly useful - not only does it allow us to limit our children's use of their screens, it also allows us to reward them for having completed tasks such as music practise, by giving them extra time.  We've also found the facility to interrupt their screen time for meals etc great - it has eliminated shouting up the stairs to get them to come to table for a start. It is also really helpful to be able to see what they are looking at without having to look over their shoulder. The children themselves aren't always the biggest fans, but they aren't big fans of us telling them that their time is up either. This has eliminated the ""I just need to finish this level"" element. We have had a few glitches with the app but the company takes these seriously and works hard to iron them out. A great app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Which means it's perfect. I can see what apps he downloads and how much time he spends on certain sites. The time blocks are great.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome App,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I think that we should be able(not have to!) assign time limits to each individual day. And have time left over from the day carry over to the next day(And I'm a kid!).,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The new version requires a button that has been moved to another screen since the tutorial was made, so you will need help from support to find it. Also it would not install on Galaxy Note 3 after repeating details of the problem ten times to support. This problem was reported some months ago, without a fix or explanation yet. The lollipop install requires a full wipe and reset. The older version is not smart enough for kids over 9 years. A year ago when everything was in perfect order this app takes a lot of work, but is exactly what you need for parenting. Remember that to control gaming you will need constant input from the parent to resolve tasks completed. If you let your kid use your phone once or hide your code poorly, you are in for hours of fighting, account questions and reinstallations. Be prepared for a huge job which is necessary to supervise gaming. Maybe better the kids become game junkies? Why does not Android allow an admin account on phones?",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. My 8 year old even thinks it's fun to take pictures of his finished tasks. Takes the argument about how much time has really been spent out of it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Good way to control usage,  also let's you see what apps and Web sites your child is on.

Our  children are all under 12 years old and we just recently got tablets for them. I noticed that within weeks all they wanted to do was sit around and play there tablets. I began looking for an app that would help me with this problem. I looked at several free ones, but none were as comprehensive as this app. I really like the task feature. I can create any task to complete for extra time.",5

Neither has complained since it's been installed, and my daughter even commented on her improved sleep patterns! The parent side of the app is easy to use once you work your way around it, and I think runs a good balance between functionality and complexity.

You can set the app to turn off any apps at certain times. You can block certain apps completely and set up a bed time schedule and a during school schedule if needed. I gave 4 stars because they can still answer incoming calls but not make them.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I like it a lot but my daughter complaints that it doesn't always work well. I just upgraded to make sure it works.    I still need to learn a lot before rating it a 5:   I have recommended it to many moms.,4

I have had it over a month now and have yet to have any problems. Keep in mind the one star ratings may be from the kids that are finding their screen time limited - exactly what this app is made for! What have I used it for? 1) Setting daily limits for time spent on games, video, etc. 2) Blocked any apps that I didn't want him to have access to at all 3) Allowed other apps (music, calendar, educational, reading) to not be restricted by a daily time limit (but still restricted by bedtime - no midnight reading when he should be sleeping!) 4) view daily reports of how much time AND what he has used it for at for the day 5) easily change the restrictions from my phone - adding time if needed (car rides, etc.) or taking away (bad behavior) While I can see some kids resenting it, it has improved our struggles. He knows his limits and can decide (within reason) when to use his time and I don't feel the need to nag him. Great app, highly recommend!!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a parent looking to limit their child in school,  out of school and what apps, this is for you!  You will have to pay for the full version,  but well worth it.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Parent of 3 kids, 7, 9, & 12.  We have had issues with facebook, game downloads, and using when they were not supposed to.  We had looked for an app with the features we needed and found it with Screen Time.  You can do an overall block, school hour block, and night time block.  We also have a usage time limit set.  You can block the Google Play store with Screen time, then use the website from a computer to remote install apps from the Play store, then unlock the new app with screen time.  The tablet/phone needs to be connected to the internet for the updates to take effect.  The devices are not rooted, so as some reviews mentioned, a factory reset would be a possible bypass, but you are assuming the kids you are concerned about know how to perform the reset.  If this is the scenario, obviously keep an eye on the tablets themselves and watch usage.  If the  app reports zero time used when you know the tablet is actually in use, its time to teach your child a lesson about how life was like before technology.   The app doesn't replace parenting, but it is a useful control tool.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Fantastic app. I thought I knew my daughter but I was extremely surprised at how she was using her tablet. To be honest I don't relish the idea of playing policeman but in these days of Internet grooming you really do need to keep an eye on what your kids get up to online.  The app gives a huge amount of control which leads to a certain amount of resentment (the app blocker especially.) However it can be used more subtlety to track rather than block.  You can even track your child's location!,5

I tried many apps out there and none measure up to screen time.  It goes way beyond just being able to restrict how much time they use on their devices.  I particularly like that some blocks are not affected by the time limit - we let them read books as long as they want. Also the app log which shows how long they spend on each app is very helpful - a lot of time on kik messenger told me I needed to take a look and see who and what was being texted.  Ability to give extra time for task completed is neat, we have not used it too much though. Overall this app came out on top for me and I looked at and tried a lot.  Well worth the money!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"So far, so good. I like that I can assign tasks for extra time, and that my kids can take a picture of whatever job they've done and it'll come to me through the Screen Time app. I like the ""bedtime"" and ""lights out"" timers. I haven't had to use the ""pause"" button yet, but if there are any problems, I'll let you know here.  We tried using Verizon FamilyBase, but my son's phone did a hard reset on it's own (I can't fully believe that my son didn't have anything to do with it, but that's a different story), and the FamilyBase Companion app never installed properly on the phone again, despite it being a pre-loaded app.  Rather than waiting around for Verizon to figure out the problem, I decided to try Screen Time. The premium features are cheaper per year than what Verizon was offering, so I bought the premium version. I like that I can see what my son is doing when he's on the internet, I like that I can see exact time spent on each app, and I like that he's aware of the time he's spending online.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The features are well designed for our house (10 and 12 year olds), it's solidly built, and the support has been timely. Highly recommended!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Interface can be a bit laggy sometimes but very happy.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent app. Really helps us monitor our sons usage and to put time limits on his tablet,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app!  Like that we can control how much time they spend on electronics.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It is a great app and has helped a lot to control my kids' use of their mobiles/tablets. The support and follow-up is also great, with personal messages being replied by the team immediately. One of the great benefits is that you can have the same control both through the mobile app and the web interface, which means that as long as you have internet you can have remote control from virtually everywhere. But even if you are left without internet, you can still control the settings from the child's app by logging in to locked settings. The reward time function also works great and would suggest someone to definitely use it. I was sceptical to buy a subscription initially, but it is worthwhile. There are points to be improved or functions to be added, but all the basics (and a lot more) are there and you get excellent value for your money.   Oh... and my kids really hate it!!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app sucks I'm surprised that people even like it I've had way better apps your an idiot if you like this app,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The idea is good, but as a parent using it, information it should give you is very poor. I'm currently using it but looking for different parental control app.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Was looking for a way to better control the amount of time my teens are spending on their tablets and also control what apps they can access. This app EXCEEDS my expectation and the 14 day trial gives you FULL access to set up the app. The prices for a subscription are affordable and there are enough options to keep the app no matter what you can afford. Monthly is like the price of netflix and a one year subscription is no more than 40 with an extra two months free! Totally worth the price. Amazing app!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The parameters regarding time on devices are clearly established, as are tasks which can extend that time. Not only are my children, ages 4, 8, and 11, independently learning to budget their screen time, they are also completing jobs around the house without being asked. Initially they grumbled at the implementation of this app, but it's become a regular part of their routine. LOVE THIS APP. Wish it worked on Apple products as well.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I am a parent and I love this app. I can see how much time is spent on each app, place time limitors on use, and use it to reward for completing tasks I assign for extra time. The best part is I can make changes and add time on my phone and I don't need to have my child's device. *note the 1 star ratings are from kids which means this app works*",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love the app,  but my kids hate it. Considering the cost of netflix I think it is a bit pricey.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Have tried it before, kids don't like it though, I wonder why :-) This will keep their tablet addiction under control. I can really suggest everyone to use this app, sure it is not for free but it so worth it. Keep up the good work.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Awesome app!! Only way you would not love this app if you are the child who can't be a tablet zombie anymore.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,works well now that issues with android 5.1 were fixed,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Very impressed with this app. Enables me to time limit certain apps, whilst allowing free access to others in a time window. Keeps me updated as to what has been used. It also have clever features allowing a bedtime window where only certain apps (ie. reading) can be used. Highly recommended,",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent way to incorporate time management with kids . No more staying up late on games.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is total garbage. Don't get it,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app because now my kids just know that they can't play their tabs in the morning b4 school because it is blocked then. Has also stopped them from sneaking the tabs into their bedrooms of a night time. Thanks for making life a little easier,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The best app I have found so far but is there a version for iPhone?,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app - works really well, very easy to use, and finally enables us to control how much screen exposure our kids get. At the end of the day, they now know how long they can use the tablet and are able to manage their time on their own. Highly recommended and worth the subscription!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best parental control app that I have found. Support is also very helpful and responsive.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I am a kid and my dad put this app on my tablet and now I can control myself on my tablet I think its awsome thanks screen time,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great app and does what it says. Helps monitor activity and communicates expectations and limits with kids. I don't know of any other app that can give parents control like this one. My only regret is that all the features that make it useful are also premium once the free trail runs out.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. My child hates it. It allows me to gain control without all the back and forth yelling and screaming. It takes a few days for the child's frustration to subside.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"You do not love your child, if you do not have this great great app installed on your child's device. So hurry now and show some love to your child by installing this app and experience terrific peace of mind that someone is always watching when you are not.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Continually would lock kids phones even after chore was approved and time was added by parent. Constant malfunction forced us to disable, uninstall, and reinstall app several times. Wasted $20 because I finally just gave up. I would recommend just using the free trial. Oh and, my teen figured out how to disable it in the first day.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love that I can limit their time on all their devices. I can see what apps they use and what websites they visit. They now monitor themselves because they don't want to run out of time too early in the day. If they get in trouble I simply block their device completely. Only thing I'd like added is a total time limit across multiple devices. For instance total 4 hours a day regardless of which device is being used rather than having to set separate time limits per device.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The best app I have found for monitoring and limiting my kids time on their tablets!  Keep up the good work!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app., The most effective way is you should talk, explain and ensure they agree with your objective prior install on your kid device.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app - IF it works.  I gave it two tries, spent a lot of time to make (update, re-install, re-connect, re-everything for several times) it work on  2 devices. It's all the same, I failed to make it work. Right now my son is playing, but it is not recorded in any way. My daughter, restricted to 3 hours daily, has been using her phone for almost 5 hours yesterday.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Kids are so dependent on these devices now-a-days and it usually involves arguments and confiscating them to get them off. This app takes care of that. Now my kids know how long they have and can earn more time as a reward for doing their chores and playing outside.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is great parental control app in the market so far. One more feature to make it the best. I wish it has periodic break feature. For example, to take a break for 5 minutes every 30 minutes of continuous play. It will prevent eye nearsightedness. Thank you.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It doesn't work well at all,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This does everything I needed when looking for parental controls for my kids' devices.  I can set profiles, control screen time, see what they're up to and motivate them with the tasks feature.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've spent so much time telling my kids to get off their tablets and go outside to play. Usually I'd have to physically take the tablets away. Screen time let's you limit your tots tech time easily and flexibly. I love that I can also pause their game time with a message ""dinner time!"" and they come down right away. What's really interesting is that since my kids know how much time they have to play each day, they actively budget their time without my having to force it. I recommend it warmly.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The only reason this app isn't rated higher is the kids rating it one star!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Wish it wasn't so expensive..,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I am testing to replace another app. So far so good. I will probably be suggesting features through the app. After 4  days it looks as I will be uninstalling my previous app. After 8 days I have been unable to find any problems with the app. with all of the features I am going to uninstall applock and use this app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Unfortunately this stops working on mine & my childrens devices frequently. Very annoying! Not good value for money because of this reason. Have to uninstall, reinstall & set up all over again at least once a week.",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Once I paid for the premium package the software works well. To the miss fortune of my granddaughter.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I am not very tech savvy, but tech support responded promptly to my cries for help, and I am not constantly worried about staying one step ahead of my teen. He does not like the app, however, which I think is a GOOD thing!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Great app to control and monitor the kid's usage of their tablets. Although I noticed that notifications for approvals of tasks completed aren't being consistently pushed. Sometimes when I refresh the app, I get a couple of days worth of completed tasks to approve.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My only complaint is on creating new tasks. It seems like it lags out really bad as I add more tasks.

My daughter, obviously, despised this app as soon as it was in use but she's gotten used to it and it's not a fight anymore getting her to do extra chores in order to earn time on her phone AND she's much more open about the content of what she's viewing/reading on her phone because she knows 'big brother'is watching. I hate that so many parents need an app like this but I'm so grateful that this app is available!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My son is techno mad and downloads games he really shouldnt play. Also like most once on his tablet he dosnt listen or do as asked.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,No longer works with 5.1.1,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Worked well at first I was singing it's praises.  Paid for the app.  Now the screen time does not work for one of my children.  Tried leaving a message no reply.  Now I have had to cancel the subscription one month into it after paying £30.00. It is a shame really.  I had high hopes.  If it works on your device you will love it.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app could not be better. Want to pause the tablet play for lunch? Kids will suddenly appear. Want to limit daily usage without screaming matches? This is your solution. Want your kids to make their bed, clean up their rooms, hang up their towels? Reward them through this app with extra time. Excellent for kids who are 'addicted'. Just get it. Used properly it will change your life.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Used it a while ago and was suprised that it was free. Now my child has a phone and went to install it and now have to pay for it. Makes sense to pay, it's a great tool for parents.",5

There is no option to pay besides subscription, and that makes me very uncomfortable.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I was so hesitant to buy my son a phone, but this app has allowed me to have total control over his phone even when I am not there with him.

It's exactly what we've been looking for!  Very easy to install and use!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Can you add the option to have certain apps available all the time so they are not on a time frame.  My kids read and would like to have things like that open even after bedtime hours are closed.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Customer service always responds very quickly to  any issues and gives great instructions on how to resolve. My 1 suggestion would be to allow an ""interrupt"" for parents who wish to have certain chores done before continuing with Screen time. Kids are currently at home, while I am at work. I left before they got up and wish to have them complete a few chores before getting on devices. An ""Interrupt"" with the ability to customize what chores are desired for each child before continuing on tablets would be AWESOME. Just a thought though. Love this app!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Latest kid scam is waiting until my phone is unattended and using remote to add additional time or disable options. Phone doesn't have a lock at home so a password specific to the remote would be a big help. Good app overall though.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,There is NOT another app out there that gives a parent the control they need and do so conveniently!  Being able to pause or offer more time at the click of a button from your mobile device...power!

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I would have considered paying the premium for this if there was a way to disable the pop up messages from the developers. It also didn't monitor usage when my kids weren't connected to the Internet which often rendered it useless.,3

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Screen Time is a good idea, and has most of the functionality needed.  But it is a bit flakey.  In particular the website doesn't load properly on either a Windows PC or an Android phone.

I purchased a years subscription but won't renew unless the entire system performance is greatly improved.",2

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Security is a bit of an issue, and we're still on a learning curve but this app has given us MUCH more control of how our kids spend their time. I'm guessing the ""1"" star ratings are from kids who have had to put their electronic devices down once in a while.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"If the app would require a password when logging into app from parents phone instead of using Google or FB log in and automatically logging in this would be great! The way it is now, kids can go on parents phone and change things when parents are sleeping. Most kids know the pin/password to unlock the parents phone. I use this on my android phone, I shouldn't have to log out of Google or fb because of 1 app. Set it up so there is a pin/password. Still 2 stars 😠",2

Set up a guest user partition onuour tablet, install this app in there and pretty much control from there. No need to lock settings and stuff giving flexibility to configure wifi and bluetooth. More importantly, the kid knows s/he is being watched, so no fooling around. Kids may not like it, but hey, its either this or no tablet. Agreed there are parents out there who are irresponsible or careless, so you do have to make sure who your kids hang out with. That this app cannot do for you. Other than that, it replaces you holding the tabled for your kid",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Amazing and yet always improving! 10 stars!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very useful a must have for parents with young children.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I wanted to give my children freedom to play on their tablets but limit how much time per day they could spend on it.  This fit the need perfectly.  I also like the email notifications when new apps are installed and when the daily limit is reached.  Good job building this app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is a great and easy way to control how long my son is on his tablet. I just purchased the full version and my son is offering to do chores now in return for a few more minutes on his tablet. If you have kids you need to download this app.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Hard to install.  It is free for 14 days and $40/year after that.  If it's not free, don't say that it's free.  Wasted my time.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Lots of problems. Very complacated. Hard to control.... Your children comes to hate you becase of the app. And it makes them think that games are there main priority. Dont get it,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Why set your child up for failure by having arbitrary time restraints. Give them a routine and they will know exactly what to expect. Less fights. Tailor your tasks to your kids, works great for us because we have 4 at very different ages.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Confusing as hell to set up.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Gave my children pads loaded with educational apps and age appropriate games. However, I was concerned that the usage of the devices may be a bit excessive so after a bit of research decided to download Screen Time Parental Control to enable download restrictions, app blocking and time limits. After a while, I noticed that my eldest child was using the pad long after the set time limits, so I watched what was going on for fear that the password had been found out. Nope, the password wasn't the problem...... my eldest (a 7 year old) had figured out a loophole in the app and taught this to my other children. This has now made the features of the app redundant, so I have removed the app from the pads and now manually control access.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is only a trial. Waisted my time,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"After the free trial, I haven't subscribed for premium because there's no solution to limit calls/texts without limiting contact between my daughter and my own phone. Yes, I can change limits or pause from my phone&contact her, but she can't do the same if she needs to contact me. There needs to be an option to establish ""always allowed"" numbers. Also would be nice to have a phone locator, and ability to read sms messages from my phone. 3 free apps would be fine but not 3 paid apps to cover monitoring teens",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works really well and keeps my daughter from staying up late on her phone without argument! Plus my son loves earning extra time by completing tasks.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It allows great control of kids devices and apply limits of time spent and block unwanted apps. Love to be able to disable the device at night, wish it was variable each day of the week. Love the remote. Thank you",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"For parents that are concerned about to much screen time, what your kids of all ages are doing, preventing the use of inappropriate apps or Internet, looking to motivate your kids to do something around the house or dare I say go out and play, not be on their phones or tablets all day or all night then this app is for you. Call it whatever you like, this is about being a parent people. Ignore the 1 star reviews just mad kids. You will love it. Oh and Google you get zero stars for banning the free version.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Worse thing ever hate it,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Well worth the premium subscription to end fighting about tablet time,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great way to be a responsible parent!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has entirely eliminated fights over screen time in our house. Plus I can control the amount of time they are on their phones when they aren't home. It's a huge relief to not have to argue anymore about phones and tablets.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Really good app for limiting time spent on devices, limiting what apps are accessed etc.  We explained to the kids why it was important to limit screen time and they have accepted it and understand when their screen time ends for the day.  Really nice feature to allow them to do their chores for some extra screen time too!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The best parental control!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My kids were not happy at first because I could set time limits on their phones. But after the first week, they adjusted to it fine and is actually better than constantly negotiating/arguing over when to get off. They actually like to earn more time doing chores and I get more help around the house without having to constantly ask and nag. Love the pause and play features. Can instantly pause their phone from anywhere! Awesome app. Have recommended it to several fellow parents!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So..nice,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I don't have kids, but I downloaded this for myself because I used my phone way too much and never did my homework. I'm a lot happier now and I love this app :)",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"would like a bit more flexibility, but works as advertised.  my son is upset, so it must be working ;)",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is so good you should make it cost $6.99,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This has ended a few battles. My kids still get upset when their time runs out but their annoyance is usually directed at the app and not at me. I love that I am no longer trying to keep track of timing multiple screen sessions a day. I also love that my kids can earn more time via competing tasks. The pause function is also great, as is the ability to select which apps are subject to timing/limitation. We have had a few glitches with regard to time running out too soon but that is usually solved easily.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Wouldn't let the phone connect to the WiFi, even though I didn't tell it to, so it couldn't send me a password reminder. Then they wouldn't let me sign in to my account remotely.",1

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"We installed this app a little over a month ago. We sat our child down after months of battling over how much time they were addicted to video and said we were going to try something new. We explained how too much video is bad for them and set limits with them. Now, when their time runs out, it just blocks them from using it. If I want to reward them with more time, I can, but I'm in control. Thank you for ending the fighting in our home!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Loved it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"OK ........so I never could get the one for my daughters phone to ever download........well, I did once but the second it downloaded, my daughter erased it................NOT SO MUCH! Guess I'll keep trying to get it to work...........I'm not going to pay for more than one month if the darn thing can't work right! 😡",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Fantastic app and service!  Great attention to all the details necessary to make this effective (app-specific customization of time limits, multiple kids, multiple device users, etc.).  The remote management features and notifications are awesome.  This makes the process of limiting screen time so much less contentious. I bought 2 Android tablets to replace iPads just to use this app.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My two kids would want to spend their days on their tablets going from MineCraft to YouTube to Crossyroads etc. Now they must first complete a task (math for 10 minutes, read for 20, clean room, put away clothes etc) to earn 15 minutes at a time. Well worth the paid version to have the additional features. They are much better at finding things to do and aren't so grumpy. Thanks!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I had another version of the app, and now I had to uninstall it because it was interfering with me uninstalling other apps... Such a huge waste of time!",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app is ok, but it will not track Chrome web history only the basic browser.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Seriously? I used to have this app, but kids theses days are too smart for stupid blocking apps. There are plenty of ways to get around the blocker thing. Will work for younger kids, but it won't work ages 8+. Even my little sister figured out how to get around it! Lol. Needs more blocking if you want to have it work.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I think it is a good app, but my dad uses it for my sister and i and we are already teenagers! This app is great and all, but i think that it should not be able to be used on teens. So can you make it so that it wont work for teens or make it banned or something, thanks!PLEASE!!!!!",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Perfect for restricting what my kids do on their android devices and also when and for how long they do it. Limits I set remotely remain in place even when their device loses all data connections. Customer service from the developer is second to none. I can't recommend Screen Time strongly enough.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works really well and updates quickly on child device. Developer has responded quickly and effectively to comments and suggestions. Only gripe is having to accept permissions on child device - can this be added to the parent app so this can be done remotely? Web restrictions are coming and will be welcomed - I've set up another app for that. Oh and iPad app too? I've set up restrictions on my husband's so the kids can't access certain sites, now can't remember the passcode...",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is awesome.  We have 7 phones that use it and my wife and I use the remote. My kids hate it. So that should tell you how well it works.   We looked for 6 months to find a good app. This is it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,No more fights over trying to shut down the tablet. The timer is set to shut it down same time everyday and sooner if chores are not completed. It has brought peace back into our home. Thank you for creating this!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Wonderful tool if you want to manage what your kids use and how much.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love being able to monitor my children's devices - apps installed, time used, etc. No more wrestling the phone away when game time is up or worrying about what they are searching for on their phone. The guidelines are set and everyone is on the same page.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has given me the confidence that not only do I know how long my kids are on their screens but, I know exactly what they are doing on them too.  It took a couple days to tweak it to fit our needs but it has been a great stress relief.  With 4 kids it was challenging to constantly be on top of them all...to keep track of what they were each doing.  But with Screen Time that has been taken care of it.  Our kids weren't thrilled to start off,  but they know what to expect now.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app! I can monitor the usage on my kids' devices and shut them down when needed. I recommend to all of my friends whose kids have tablets and phones.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love the options for great customization.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is prefect. I am able to control every aspect of my kids tablet usage. I recently looked at my kids' google searches through the app and discovered that they were looking at inappropriate content. Without this app I would have never known.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has everything you need to control phone usage. I think the only thing missing would be a calendar where we can put in events and have it auto pause and give her a notification. I'd pay double for this app. It rocks!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My husband and I love this app as it let's us monitor what's used, time used, search history, and the ability to block anything inappropriate on the kiddos phone. It helps manage attitudes because of the pause /play feature. We did the trial and decided this is a must have for any tweenager.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Installed with the trial period and I love it so much, I'm sold on the paid yearly plan. If you have kids that are obsessed with their time on the phone, get this app. The kids will fuss for a little while, but mine have gotten use to it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love it. My child hates it. It allows me to stop him using apps at school in class time, but turn it back on as soon as school ends. I love the turn off at night I just wish leaving phone only at night and everything else off was simpler, like a button choice. If this worked on the iPad it would be on there as well. I recommend this to all parents who endure the frustration of their children being constantly on their phones or tablets.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Easy to use and works great. My kids hate it but that's the point. When you run out of time that's it. Its not a negotiation.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,getting my kids off the screens can be like entering thunderdome but this is a great app for giving parents limits and control in an organized and positive way.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best app for parental control. Beware of 1 star reviews from children :P,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I installed this on my 12 year old daughter's phone and tablet after realising responsibility I was expecting her to demonstrate at her age was unfair; I was setting her up for a fall. I love this app. She gets additional time for showing initiative or kindness or managing her responsibilities well. She's learning resource and time management skills. She can chat and message and and listen as she likes within appropriate boundaries.  She sometimes chafes against the restrictions, but she's safe.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I absolutely love this app! Of course my 13 year old hates it,  but that just means it is doing its job.  I can monitor all of her activity remotely and if there is something inappropriate, I can block it without worrying about her reinstalling it.  There is also a quick turnaround if you ever have questions.  If you're an involved parent and want to monitor your child's activity,  this is a must have!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great Android solution for the kids tablets. I just wish it could be used on apple and Nintendo DS as well for combined totals.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Really helps us monitor and limit how much time my kids are on their tablets. Great features that make it easy to see when and what my kids are doing when they are playing their tablets. I recommend this app because it is worth paying for peace of mind.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is the best app ever.  Turn your child's tablet into a two pound paperweight in seconds.  This app used in combination with good parent/child communication about limits is a win for both parties. No argument about turning off the games, just time management lessons when it turns off half through evolving their mythical house cat.  Great app, at a great price.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"A flexible app that lets me control my 9 year old's screentime with blocked apps, bedtime, schooltime settings.

The only downside is that the premium remote controller is a bit pricey but hopefully that will come down with as the userbase grows.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is great for kids who spend too much time on their tablets or phones! You can reward them with more time for doing chores or helping around the house. My kids will ask to do more chores for more time which has never happened before we had screen time. Definitely worth the download.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My kids have done really well with it. They actually offer to do more chores to earn more time. I also don't catch them up all night on it instead of sleeping.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Though my children are less than fond of the app, it has greatly reduced the struggle of putting away the devices at the end of allotted time and   has ended disagreements about how long they have been on. We use device removal to assist in discipline so remote access is great!  We recommend to all our friends struggling to control screen time.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I was introduced to this app by my brother who uses it on his two boy's tablets. They are 7 and 5. And now I use it for my 8 year old. She hates it, but then all kids hate doing chores no matter what you use as aa bribe. I do wish I'd known about this app before my 3 year old locked himself (and me) out of his tablet because then I could have blocked him from playing with the settings that locked us out! Anyway, it's a brilliant app and I highly recommend it to all parents!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app has been a total game changer in our house. Before installing this app on my kids' tablets, it was impossible to unplug them. Now, they know that when their time is up, they are done for the day. They are more inclined to help around the house to earn more time, as well. This app has been a Godsend! So far, my kids (11 and 8) have been fairly complacent with the app and without much argument. I consider myself lucky after seeing the reviews posted by other kids. Haha!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Child isn't to happy, but this is better than not having a phone at all !!! These kids these days don't know what it's like to go without technology. If they aren't happy with the app then maybe they should go out and get a job and pay for the cell phone bill themselves. us parents work too hard to let our money go to waste by allowing our children to be out doing whatever whenever & however they want. The kids that are rating this a 1 star need to be doing something more productive.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I tried several other similar apps before this one.   I even paid for premium service on a few others.  They all ended up being a big waste of time and money.  My kids would find ways around them, they would error and randomly shut down, or just plain didn't work.   Not with this app!   This Screen Time and Remote have been the best.  I have no complaints in the several months of using it.  I would highly recommend it!  I especially love the app log and bedtime timer.",5

Yes my son wasn't thrilled when I first put the app on his phone, but after a discussion with him about why we put it on there he accepted it. He also  learned time management with it.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I don't use all the features, but it's nice to have more awareness and control of my kids tablet usage. Mostly use the bedtime blocker. We let him listen to approved audio books at night and this lets us open up that app and block all others at night.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My daughter has an Htc one M8 phone and she knows how to get around the program on her phone and change the allowed time and also be able to use some programs even after its locked... All without knowing my password. Very upsetting when I find that she was texting at 3am.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love the flexibility and affordability of this app!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app! It keeps my son from using his tablet more than he should as well as at times he shouldn't be using it. With Screentime I can control when, how long the tablet is used, and what apps are allowed and not allowed. One of my favorite aspects of this app is that I can create tasks that give him more time when the tasks are completed. It's easy to use, and helps limit his screen time!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This does almost everything I want and is easy to use. I like the ability to select individual apps that are exempt from limits. I like that there is a useful free version but that the subscription also has useful enhancements. The biggest shortcoming is that it does not deal adequately with multiple devices used by a child. However a workaround is to create a ""new"" child  for additional devices.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love the idea. It needs a ""time"" or ""alarm"" for chores to be done. So it goes off and locks the phone/tablet until it is checked off by the parent. For example : ""brush your teeth - alarm set for 9am"" or ""feed the cat- alarm set for 12pm"" my daughter is using all her time in the morning then does the chores when she needs more time. The app is easy to use and I like it a lot but I need for it to make her manage her time better. Other than that I would give it 5 starts",4

It gives me a run down of their activity and when we are at family functions I can ""pause"" their screen time during family time. Because the boys or their own passwords to lock their phone, I can choose which apps to lock THEM out of. Plus it saves us the hassle of taking phones away when they're really in trouble. We don't always have to keep an eye on the clock to tell them to turn off their devices.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I like and dislike this app because you said we only get 10 minutes for doing chores cleaning my room doing something nice or doin homework and reading my dad thought this was unreasonable so he gives me 2 hours or more for doing these things I love the remote control thing because he can give me more time from far away for doing chores homework etc and I gave really started to do more work around the house to earn money but when you update the app I can not play on my phone please fix this :).,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app works as advertised BUT.. The problem is that my son found a way around it in about 2 minutes. Since it is an app, it takes time to load before it is active. He simply restarts his phone, opens whatever app he desires before the software activates and renders the security basically useless. He can open and use anything he desires this way. If the app could block restarts or fix this bug, it would be a 7 star app.  UPDATE: As requested, I have tried three times to contact you via email to fix the issue described above as you requested, but to this day, I have not received a response. Not in Spam, not in my inbox...no reply.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As another parent mentioned, this app is fabulous. We have been using it for several years to control the time spent on our kids devices.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The kids may not like it all the time but they understand why we use it after we explained it to them.   With the daily reports it is an incredible tool to monitor and manage the time all our kids spend in front of a screen. That can be a challenge for us with as busy as we are and all the running around we do.   Also the  tasks really help motivate our kids to understand that we need to be responsible and get our chores done before we play. And helps us introduce  new responsibilities to them while attaching reward to them (meaningful reward to them).,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"For the very reasonable subscription price, it's incredible just how much control and monitoring you get from the app. As the app gets better in time, it's bound to become a powerhouse in a parent's arsenal of tools to keep their kids safer and out of online trouble. There are multiple methods to control a child's time spent on their device and even a reward system (that can be easily adjusted by the parent) to give extra time for good deeds done. With website tracking, search queue tracking, and the all powerful ""just lock them out of their device because I fee like it"" function, there is no reason why you should pass up this opportunity for some piece of mind.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I very happily paid the subscription fee for this.  It allows a Big Brother view on  exactly what our kids have been up to on their tablets and we use both the daily allowance and bedtime features to limit ""tablet time"".

The remote control and monitoring features are clean and easy to use.  While the kids can get frustrated with hard limits on screen time, it's also incredibly motivating for them to complete their tasks and has become the main form of currency in the house for small household chores.  I don't pay for a lot of apps.  Let's face it.. I'm a dad.  I happily paid for this one and am looking forward to new features.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is exactly what I was looking for when I purchased my 3 children their smart phones. I have the ability restrict access to any app during school, bed time and any other time I desire. My favorite part is being able to limit the amount of time they can use the phone during the day. If they do their chores, home work, have good behavior, ect.  they can send a request for more time and I have the ability to accept or decline their requests. This really is a great app!!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I tried a few, but this is the only one that gave me what I wanted (and more!). My son likes that ge doesn't have to watch the clock because it reminds him when time is up. Also, he can do extra chores or reading to earn extra time. Great app!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I'm cheap, and therefore very reluctant to pay for apps, and I was even more averse to paying a recurring fee for this app, but IT WAS DEFINITELY WORTH IT. Although I had some issues with Screentime Remote (task approvals, play/pause commands not going through), Screentime's support was very responsive and found it was due to an old version of android. Once we upgraded the OS, it worked fine and my son hated it. But then something changed. Somehow I had given him access to screentime remote on HIS device, so he had the ability to approve his own tasks. But he didn’t just give himself free approvals to get around the Daily Limit, he actually performed the tasks before approving them!  He even left a FAVORABLE review of Screentime saying that he liked the Tasks feature because it motivated him to get things done.  This was a watershed moment in my son’s personal development. It was also a catalyst for him to start taking more responsibility around the house (chores), even withOUT the incentive of additional minutes of screentime. I’m cheap, so I’ve searched the Play Store and don’t see any other app (neither free, nor paid) that even promises what Screentime provides.",5

As soon as they add websites visited to the daily email, it will be PERFECT! :) The support people are awesome....VERY responsive and helpful. Thanks for a great app, Steve!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Awesome, effective, easy to use.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Lost connection 5 days out of the first 10 days of the trial.  This allowed my son to bypass every restriction.  My second complaint is that newly installed apps are defaulted as allowed in the blockers.  My son would uninstall and reinstall the app to get around blocks another way.    Other than that I thought it was a very easy to use app and would be great if it worked right.  The app needs a little more work so I am going to try other apps.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Its way overpriced ( my opinion ) . I do not like that you cannot purchase through GPlay. No subscriptions. Just one flat price for no limit would be nice. Were not keeping up with the Jones we use Android no bad apples.,3

We have been using the remote control and screen time application for about 4 months now, and I am completely satisfied with the control and monitoring that it provides us.  The flexibility is amazing as well as the relliability of the app.  My children have never known life on their tablets without it, so it doesn't bother them too much.  I am thankful for the creators if this application suite and would highly recommend this to any parent that wants a little help in making sure that their kids don't become online zombies.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Parents, This was the app we've been looking for.  If you are like me, you know that phones for kids are a double-edged sword... great for keeping in contact with them, great for education support, great for entertainment... but also potentially dangerous.  Screen Time allows you to limit what they can do with the phone, and when.  As they mature in time, you can start to decrease their restrictions and to give them more freedom. Screen Time's time limit function also forces them out of the inevitable ""trance"" they fall into after becoming engrossed in the latest game they've found.  As you may imagine, my daughter doesn't like Screen Time, but understands that we will reward her with more time, once homework and chores are completed.  Give Screen Time a try.  While I'm on the topic of keeping kids safe, I suggest everyone check out OpenDNS as well to add a whole house filter to your home's internet content.",5

They've discovered that if they turn their phone off and on again they get a window of opportunity before screentime blocks apps.. During this time they can open any  blocked apps, and once they're open they stay open.. PLEASE can the developers close this loophole and this will be a Five star app..",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I got this app to control how much time my daughter spends on her tablet.  Ever since we got her this tablet,  she spends most of her time on it. This app allows me to set how long she is on it, bedtime,  and lights out. When she runs out of time,  she can earn time by doing chores I designate and how much time is earned. I can lock it when dinner is ready. It's a great app.  Kids hate it because it does what is suppose to... get them away from the video games and back to reality. I totally recommend it.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is the first app I've ever been willing to pay a monthly subscription. I can control my grandson's tablet usage without spending a lot of time configuring apps directly on his tablet. I set it up once and do the rest remotely. I choose which apps he can't access at all and limit the amount of time on those he can. This has greatly reduced the number of arguments concerning his tablet usage. Of course he's never happy without unlimited usage but we don't argue over sneaking time on the tablet when he's not supposed to. He knows what time he's allowed and manages it how he wants. He also knows if he misbehaves I can eliminate his access in seconds but if he does extra chores or achieves certain goals he can earn extra time.  The only feature missing that would help immensely is the ability to restrict certain web sites. In my case I can limit his time using the YouTube app but then he can just go to YouTube through the browser. Can't restrict the browser because he needs it for school work.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"On top of all of all of the controls of the ""kid side""of the app, this app gives a lot of great reports and controls that you can run on your device. They even let you try it for free for a while, BUT IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!! Buy the year, it's the best deal, and then you don't have to worry about it again.

This app has allowed me to restrict the number of hours they can use them,  with additional fixed times that the pads can't be used: before school,  after 8pm, etc. No more arguments or 'discussions' about when their pads can or can't be used.  They accept that the pads are locked and don't even question it.  Great. All I have to do now is permit extra pad time, once they have done their music practice. :-)",5

I have had ScreenTime installed on my daughters tablet since last year; we love it and she understands the reason for having this in place. Now my son has a tablet and we just purchased the 1-year subscription.  If used properly, this tool is a great reminder to keep at task (homework and chores) and not get ""side tracked"" for too long playing games!! This should supplement parenting...not replace it.  Have a discussion with the kids and explain how this tool works and why.  Use it as positive reinforcement, not as a punishment.  Don't just implement and walk away.  It's evident that these discussions are not taking place by the kid's 1-star ratings riddled throughout the reviews.",5

She absolutely hated it....for a week.  Now, she loves it.   The social media 'pressure' for teenage girls is incredible.  She felt like she always needed to be checking her phone, seeing what was being updated, responding to posts.   Screentime took that pressure away from her. Now she CAN'T use her social media stuff during school or after 10 pm, because her parents are big meanies who use Screentime.      She hated it.   Now, it's the best thing ever.  She's happier.  I'm WAY happier.  Her grades have improved.   I've referred Screentime to all of her friend's parents, my brother's, my in laws.    This is the best tool to come along in FOREVER.

Tasks include reading a paper book, build with Lego's, drawing, or chores.  Often they find the other task engaging enough they don't come back for more screen time.

In both cases it seemed to be linked to when the app required an update, which she ignored, thus allowing her to use her tablet at will.  Also, on both times there was no history of  her usage for the few days it took before I noticed the problem, and by the time I realized what was going on it became an argument with her to get her app updated. When I signed up for this app it appeared to work well and it does most of the time.

Also I was able to set up the school time blocker so that he could still use his tablet for school apps and  but not texting and games. I also like that I can see his browsing history. There is just too much out there that can harm. Thank you for making an simple, but very functional app for limiting activity.

Vacuuming,helping unload the dishwasher, completing homework and using math and science apps on the tablet. I have mine set up so math,science , spelling and social studies all earn extra Play time .  kids learn to time manage very quickly and the pause feature is handy with the ""NO"" birds.  time for lunch and the child ignores you ? grab your cell and click pause,, all tablet activity stops. no argument.  love it love it love it!!!!!!!!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is absolutely superb.  A parental control app that does exactly what it says on the tin (so to speak).  Well done indeed!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My kids received tablets for their birthdays and I needed a way to limit the amount of time they spent on them.  This is the perfect solution!  At bedtime the games automatically get locked out while keeping the reading and educational apps open.  I can also set daily time limits that will lock the tablet down as well.  It has built in features where the kids can earn more time by doing chores and jobs that I set for them.  I get daily summaries and the Remote Control app allows me to instantly lock them out should the need arise.  This app is WELL worth the price and I would highly recommend it to any parent who has a child with a smart device!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is a boon to parents and also great kids. The setup is very easy and the configuration options are really good and fine-grained. Kids get the freedom to use devices and apps since, with this app, parents are confident they have blocked out undesirable apps and kids can enjoy their installed apps without any intrusion. The feature to extend time on the device is really good and also to specify activities which earn kids more time as well.The usage log is great.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Simply works.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is hands down the best for controlling when my child is able to use the phone. I use it to block all apps from 9 pm to 6 am as our rule is no phone usage during those hours, but it was not being abided by.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have tried several parental control apps, and this is one of the best. If time spent on devices is the main concern, then this the one to use.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,All your teen has to do is change the time on his phone and he can use it whenever he wants. No more bed time.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Wish that out included what YouTube videos were watched.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is great for helping your child take control of how much use of tablet, and allowing you to monitor activity and help train.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I like that it mostly does what it says and after trying many apps that my daughter was able to either uninstall or bypass, I found this to be the best. A few things I don't like are the way the remote takes you to the website in order to change your settings or do just about anything. If it's an app you should be able to use it as such. Also, I've just found out that Pandora still runs no matter what. Once my daughter launches Pandora it goes even when her lights out is in effect.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The best android app to control teenage phone abuse. Letting them sleep and do other things... Like hone work and talking to parents.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Best app ever.  Kids hate it and parents love it!!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The best app to assure security and manage your kids activities on their phone.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app!! helps me protect my kids from things they don't need to see yet.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Until I got this app controlling how my two children used their tablets was a very difficult affair.  Now it is so straightforward.  Each has 60 mins per day, more at weekends, I can set what time they can use it in the morning, what time it stops in the evening and I can also reward them remotely for chores they have done.  It also lets me monitor what apps they use, what websites they visit and all remotely.  A truly superb app and a real bargain.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Of  course kids hate this app.  They seem to think that they have a God given right to absolute privacy and control in their lives. In the real world however things work a bit differently.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app allows me to keep tabs on apps installed on my sons tablet and limit usage as needed to only productive apps. 5th star would be given if the same features could be applied to ios devices.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Kids hate it! I think it's fantastic,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My son was on his tablet all the time and even when he was told it was bed time he would push it for another five minutes. Since installing this app it shuts down when you want it too and cannot be used.  However it would depend on how much patience they have as they can still tap away at the keys until a message appears to say bed time blocker is on.  I like the idea that I can remote in from a pc and put a pause on it and also give him some reward play time if I feel he has earned it.     Few changes could be made to the program but otherwise a great app would highly recommend.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Marvelous program,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The functionality is great. Not sure I could find the function to adjust the switch off time though. Seems to flit between app and browser a lot. On the whole is great to monitor usage without nagging. In the end I had to uninstall as I don't want an on going cost to monitor usage,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Gaming is my nemesis when it comes my kids.  This app gives me the ability to set boundaries and stick to them & the kids know it. U can see what they do,  what website they visit, what they download.  I LOVE IT!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"There are other new apps recently Good Morning America TV introduced, ""DinnerTime Plus"" does almost same functions but it is free.  I willing to pay few bucks but subscription is .... well... now there are alternative.. any chance to be one time charge or free ? Thanks",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Not only an excellent way of monitoring, it's also been very useful with incorporating chores, new and old, into our daily lives. Keep up the great work!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's nice to turn off the tablet any time I want and see what my kid is doing. Dont like having to pay every month but it's worth the $ when my kid acts up I don't have to ask for her tablet I just pull out my phone and one click no more tablet. She gets mad and it's great. Talking back and ignoring me wile her tablet is in her face is a thing of the pass. Haha I got the last laugh,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So glad I found this. Worth every penny. My kids now can't pull the wool over my eyes about what they have been doing on their devices. Brilliant!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It gives you control over your kid's tablet time.  Which explains the 1-star ratings from annoyed kids.  I guess the app is working very well for their parents.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This has been a breakthrough for my household in terms of keeping the screen time under control. My son, the Minecraft junkie, actually does chores voluntarily to earn more time. There was a minor glitch in the app a couple of weeks ago which seems to have been corrected with the latest update. Your kids may hate this, but it's very effective. Recommended.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My son figured a way to crack system by simply changing date  and time on his tablet and screen time and remote no longer worked. I had high hopes for this too. Disappointed.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This is perfect but I lowered my rating because I don't want to pay monthly to use it after the trial.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We use screen time instead of money for allowance.   Makes it so easy for both mom and kids to keep track.  Dad also feels involved when he gets emails when kids request time by doing chores.  Also we can monitor hours on device.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Kids hate it, parents love it, that's the bottom line. Try it and you'll thank me.",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app to help with amount of time kids get to spend on devices. Love it.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This has helped us manage our son's time tremendously.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love the control it gives us,  without having to be the meany. Sometimes slow to register things to their tablets... That can be frustrating. Would be great if we could sign off tasks on their tablets for the times there is no wifi.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Cannot use the play/pause + message feature. It doesn't work for me. Other than that the app is terrific. Love the task/rewards feature,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Hassle free and works for the most part.  Developer seems very responsive, would like to see a few more features and bugs fixed then definitely a 5 star even after I pay for it.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love it .it shoot down at 8:00 pm then it opens the next day .it makes my life easy I don't need to reminder my son it bedtime.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app is great!  I am able to see what they are doing on the Internet.  Love the reward system for extra play minutes.  Provides an avenue to keep open communication between parents & kids about safe phone use. A must have for parents.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"""Trust, but verify."" That is my motto when it comes to my daughters' phone usage. This app makes it easy for me to set expectations with them and then check to see what they have been doing. When needed, I can lock or unlock their phones from my phone in a few seconds. The only reason it gets 4 stars from me and not 5 is that the web-based interface to change settings doesn't always work.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"When my free trial of screen time parental control ended (my phone at that time wasn't compatible with screen time remote)  i didn't  purchase the app.  A few months later my daughter and i both got the lgg2.  Then i find out she had installed an app called omegle.   Now after trying many free apps, i'm back. This is the very best app that i have found and i know as time progresses it will get better.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Ideal to keep an eye on your children.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Installed this app after having a discussion with my 10 year old son around living life not just simulating it. We set boundaries together and established ways to earn additional time. He now knows that he is in control of the amount of time he spends on his tablet. I am now free of the constant following up and nagging him to get off his electronics.  My only request is the ability to monitor multiple devices and set an overall ""electronics"" time limit.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The only change I'd ask for would be an equivalent to the school time setting that is not restricted in time it can be set. I'd like to allow my daughter access to only certain apps (like books) from bedtime to lights out and then restrict those as well. Well worth the subscription price, now if only I could find something for her PC that works the same way!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Except a few minor bugs this app is great.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've 11 years old twins. After few hours from installing this app,  they've figured out how to reset the smartphone and to reload the apps. If there was a password required than they wouldn't be able to do so and by that removing this app.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love how detailed this gets per kid!  Would recommend for anyone that has kids!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has been an invaluable tool for monitoring and keeping track of my kids smart phone. I tell everyone about it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Fantastic,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,What a great way to teach responsibility and a place and time for everything!  Plus I have the chore list set up to encourage doing more than the minimal amount of chores for extra reward time. The apps are easy to customize for any age. We're using Samsung Galaxy phones and we have not had trouble with any of screen time or screen time remote app features.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love the app, a lot less fighting.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good but some issues. First is I have to go in app and hit refresh all the time to get up to date info. Today I did that and 3 out of 4 kids got up to date info... 4th one updated to yesterday. Date and time are correct and his tab shows everything he has done all day but my app won't show me anything. Second issue is it won't block settings app. My youngest changes time all the time and I tried to stop him by blocking settings app.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Very helpful app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it. Works great!!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great basic parental app. I wish it had info on who my child is texting as well as the Web search info.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Terrific app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Purchased to make smart phone safe for 9 yr old.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love the app but wish you had a one time fee to purchase app rather than pay a monthly fee. Also needs more then one block out time for app use, like the school block out time. Also needs option to set bedtime for different times on different days. Also would be nice to have web filter built-in. DOES NOT WORK ON NABI tablets.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,So this works perfectly in every way that it says. Love creating my own chore list to let my kids earn more screen time.(it would be great if there were more space to describe chores in detail) However my real issue is that my daughters table isnt able to get the google play store on it and therefore this app will not connect to the remote. If I could get it to function without the google play services I would love it even more. Customer service was fast and courteous.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The screen time app itself is installed on my sons tablet.  It is great with all the features I love.  When I saw that I could have an app to control it easily from my phone (versus ising my phone's web browser) that made it even better.  Then I got hit with the price after the free trial.  No thanks, my son can bring me his tablet when he wants me to approve tasks or I'll use the internet.  I would have gladly paid a one time fee for the convenience of the remote control, but not an ongoing subscription.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works great.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I don't like the subscription model, I should be able to just purchase the remote control. There are a number of settings missing from the remote control that are available in the app.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Does exactly what it should do but isn't free like it says. You have to pay for it,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It does exactly what I want.  A lot of apps let you choose the times you wish to block but I wanted to restrict how long my children were on their tablets and phones between these times and that is exactly what this app dies with the added benefit of suspending their play for a few minutes while they do an errand etc.  Brilliant!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love this app! The kids are even okay with the restrictions, knowing they can earn more time with tasks.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We are using this app to help control how much time our boys are on their tablets... Love it!!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love the control this app gives me over my kids' tablets. It's very smartly done and is an excellent tool for parents. We are foster parents and it has come in very handy with regulating the kids' tablets. Love it!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Works well to limit kids time on tablets & phones. Deducted one star for the ongoing subscription charge. But in all honesty it's worth it for the peace of mind.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app. Worth every penny. My son looks for stuff to do so he can earn extra time.,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We have been using for 2 months. It has been a great incentive to get chores done for extra time. I love that I can block apps and see search history and Web history. This has been the ONLY app that has worked to control my children's time on their electronic devices.  I will be happy to pay 29.99 for a 2 year subscription. That equals $1.25 a month! Can't beat that price for the features on this app! Please take into account that 1 star rating are mostly from kids!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a great app allows you to set time limits on your kids screen time. It includes a bedtime lockdown and task which allows the kids to earn extra screen time. No doubt your kids will hate it, and looking a the reviews some of them do. I find it works well with avast antivirus app using the app locker to stop uninstall or factory reset. Its had a great effect on my kids rediscovering all the things you bought them before the tablet!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"As a parent of a 9 year old, I've found this app to be incredibly helpful. You want your kids to be able to engage with new technology but reckon 3+ hours per day is too much? Well, aside from ripping the tablet out of their hands and persuasion tactics that never seem to work twice, then we've got this app to fall back on. Yes, there are still tantrums - and Screen Time has become an object of hatred (but then again, anything attached to 'discipline' is so there's no loss) - but I don't know of any other way to get 'tablet addiction' under control, short of burning the thing. Screen Time just works.  The app itself? Everything works fine and the controls are easy to dive straight into. However, I feel the UX during 'remote control' could be smoother. Steve, I'd like to see a flatter structure, and 'settings' brought to the fore for each user  rather than a few clicks away.  Also, please develop /full/ control of the app via remote control - ie. the ability to white/blacklist apps without going to the source device, if possible.  The last two points would gain 5 stars from me instead of a very worthy 4 stars. I'd've opted for 4.5 stars if I could've!",4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Brilliant software.   If you are a parent,  get this app.   This is the best application of its kind.   I have it installed on my two daughters Android devices and it works perfectly.   Well worth the monthly fee to be able to set time limits on their devices,  see what apps they are using,  what Web searches they perform,  set up chores for additional screen time,  get alerts when the install new software,  daily reports on all activity.   Also love the bedtime and school blockers.   Well done!",5

The newest upgrade lets you set different times for weekdays (M-F) vs. the weekend where you might want to allow a little bit more time.  This app let's me block apps, control which apps count towards the alotted time (ex. I set educational games to not count against the 1 hour time limit I set for them each day) and it automatically can be set to BLOCK any new app downloaded until I have had a chance to review it and unblock it!  The companion remote control app lets me right from my phone monitor their usage, add more time, assign tasks to be completed to earn more time or send a signal to stop all play immediately.

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is amazing at letting me add tasks, as time, and control other aspects of screen time on my kids tablets. Well worth the small monthly fee for the remote app after the fourteen day trial. I've entailed for support a couple times and had very fast responses. Kudos to the programmer.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I put it on my son's tablet and it was great. But then something happened and it kept saying it was disconnected. I spent a while trying to sort it and eventually just uninstalled and reinstalled it. Now back to working very well.,4

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a great tool and worth every penny if you have kids that spend too much time on the phone and/or sneak at night. After the initial whining and griping passed after the first week because he didn't want to be limited, my son now willingly performs chores, finishes his homework without gnagging, and goes to bed on time. if only there was a Windows version of this application (Windows family safety is a mediocre solution at best and leaves a lot to be desired), would buy it in a heartbeat!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Can I suggest the ability to configure which apps to block using the remote control.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I'd like to also see a feature where I can send them a quick message from my tablet to theirs like a reminder or a memo type of thing.,4

""its no control everything, its having everything under control""  love it! sorry kids!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,UPDATE. GREAT NOW AS APP BLOCKING.  6 STARS....  My only request would be a way to always block apps from being  started ie  YouTube. This is a great way to manage kids tablet usage.  It does what I wanted an ap to do,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app. Tho my kids don't like it much I am able to get them into bed on time which is always hard cuz they r adhd. W this app they go to sleep on time cuz they know that if they don't I have the control to lessen their usage the next day. Love this app,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Not only can I limit his gaming to appropriate time limits, daytime hours, etc, I can also limit content, so games will shut off but he always has access to email, texting, wikipedia, kindle, etc.  I love the remote control function so I can grant or take away time remotely from anywhere and the daily or real time reports on what he's been doing.  Best part is it covers every device individually, so I can control his tablet, phone, and tv from one app on my phone.  Awesome!",5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My kids hate I am monitoring their usage but it is the best thing out there. To be able to know what they are watching and downloading...to be able to limit their use without constantly having to tell them time is up.

I like the flexibility in choosing which apps count towards time.  With the remote app, I can override settings remotely if needed.  Kids, you think this is because we don't love you.  No, it is because we DO love you.  You'll understand when you get older.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I'm a parent and we love this app.   It's  been great for our family.   I don't have to ask my kids over and over to turn off their devices.  Screen time does it.

As kids get older we Parents fall on the list of voices wanted to be heard.  This app changes that.  Being able to see what, specifically,  your child spends their time doing while on the phone is great but the best part of this app is the Parents ability to take control at any moment, for any reason and for any amount of time.  It changes the nature of the relationship your child has with the phone.",5

They earn their time.  Works great and worth every penny.",5

Otherwise got to reset things up every weekend or keep adding time.",5

I appreciate the ability to limit game time yet allow reading on OverDrive and Nook apps.  They have adjusted to the application quite well. They no longer lose the following day's game time from going over on the current day.  We do not have to monitor as closely. My one request would be to allow for different weekday versus weekend settings. Thank you very much! Annie,5

com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I love this app. It's great to keep up with my child. The only thing that do not like is the subscription. Because of this I will not be keeping this app. I rarely pay for any apps but would have been willing to pay a flat fee for the app but not 2.99 a month.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I really love this app for it is only as invasive as necessary to reach its goal. Other parental control softwares allow parents to read their kid's messages emails etc.  I firmly believe that is spying not parenting!  (hence this is the only Pc app I have ever installed) Thank you Steve for your sensible approach.  I hope with time my kids will also recognise the value this brilliant app provide.  If only I could specify different curfews for different days of week.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"What this app does is not worth $36 a year.  I would gladly pay a fair one time price for the app, but this is extremely pricey for the app market.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,For less then a cup of coffee I have control over my child's tablet. and I don't have to hover over her to see what she's doing. I can set how long she gets so she's learning to use her limit wisely.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Works good, it does seem to drain my battery fairly fast though.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love it!  It is really just what I was looking for.  I like how I can specify what apps to include in the daily time.limit.  Also like pause feature even though I.haven't used it.  Will gladly pay 3/month.for.these features.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Absolutely love this app.   I don't mind $3/month at all for peace of mind.  After having had a scare with online predators and my daughter,  $3 is a cheap price to pay to know my kids are safe.  Plus the developer worked with me to get things set up correctly and working.  Very helpful.  Thanks So much.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,We mom,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"All I can do is see how long my kids have used their tablets.   I have it set for lights out at 8pm est.  Here it is 8:47pm est, and my daughter is sitting beside me playing on her app. I did not have to put in a password.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"like but the remote doesnt work tried to lock device and doesnt. Also, didnt realise you had to pay $3 per month. What a con... we want to keep our kids safe omline and you want to make money. would be better if you could lock down play store. Just lost a user",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Nice!,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"When I set the time limits for my kids, it had no effect on their tablets. Also, what's the difference between bedtime and lights out? I thought I saw information about it when I installed the app, but now I can't navigate to any informational or setup screens.  The final straw is that it's not obvious that you have to pay for the app after 14 days. That information is buried in the description and only shows up after the app is set up. I feel deceived and am looking for alternatives now.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,More instructions would b helpful.,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Too many bugs to pay monthly for. Also lacks many features.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,$3 a month forever is much too high.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Great app not for $3/mo though,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I'm trying to pause a tablet with the remote and nothing is happening,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This app has saved a lot of fights in the house. I love being able to remotely control the kids tablets.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,There's other apps that do more and are cheaper. Add more features or charge less,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I couldn't get the messaging or rewarding extra time to actually work. I would have persevered, but then I realised it needs a 2.99 fee, MONTHLY. Not a one off, which I would have paid, but a MONTHLY subscription, you've got to be joking, the app doesn't even work properly. Even if it a did, a MONTHLY subscription is just taking the biscuit. Did I mention they expect you to pay every month, just take the darn tablet off the kid and give them the 2.99 pocket money for doing chores!",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The app on my son's phone works ok, but my remote disables frequently and does not update. It hasn't updated since the day I installed it. I am not able to see what apps he's been on and for how long. I don't think the remote controls anything. And, in 11 days I'll have to start paying for it!?",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,A must have app for all parents who wanna control and oversee the usage of their kid's devices.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is awesome! Paired with the parental controls on my son's tablet, I am able to monitor exactly what he is playing and downloading.   I love being able to set bedtime. I also love being able to send and approve tasks to earn extra time! What a great motivator!!  It's also a nice touch to be able to pause screen time for lunch or other activities (or if there is misbehavior!) As well as allowing unlimited access for car trips or long appointments (or whatever the need).  Thank you!!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I really like this application, and it is working well to monitor my daughter's new tablet. A feature I would like to see added is the ability to view web browser history and blacklist/whitelist websites. Unfortunately, the cost of subscription is just too high: $2.99 a month is just too much to spend every month if you only need to control one device. I believe either charging a one-time fee for the app, or $0.99 a month for each device you want to control is much more reasonable and would result in more sales/subscriptions. Alternatively, add web browser access as soon as possible - optimized for mobile browsers, ideally - and charge a small subscription (like $0.99/month or $4.99/6 months or $8.99/year) for advanced features.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Set the remote for bed time disable to off on two accounts. Even after 2 days of being used, both tablets that I am controlling, still disabled at bedtime, despite the remote control being set to off two days ago, so I'm not sure the remote control is controlling anything. Second, I really don't like when app creators list their app for ""free"", but after 14 days, want a $3/ month payment for as long as you'd like to keep an eye on your kids. 10 years in our case. If the remote worked, I would pay the price, as I do like the program, but resent the misleading ""free"" statement. Just say up front what you want.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"My wife and I use this to keep our sons tablet time under control. We love the ability to grant him More time for doing jobs around the house. And I really like being able to  remotely control settings. The monthly fee for the remote app is not too bad for such a feature filled solution. Of course I wish it was free but after I tried it, we think it's worth it.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a brilliant app. My children each have a tablet and I can now effectively manage the amount of time and where it is spent in each app. I love the partnered app to control their devices remotely and how you can block them from uninstalling the app (if your children can uninstall it, you didn't set it up right). Simply genious!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Regurgitation?!,",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"While this app does a great job with the time limits and letting me see what my son is doing on the internet, the feature that is supposed to let you message your child and either pause or extend time does not work. I also wish that it had an internet filter. After I purchased this none of the remote control options worked, when I contacted customer service the it was not resolved. Have canceled subscription.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Usually am a big fan of this app, but tonight my daughter figured out a way to uninstall the app on her tablet.   Fortunately she was honest about it, but I'm puzzled how she did it.  She said she was frustrated about having no more time today, and kept trying to uninstall it, and after 5 or 6 times, it worked.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,This seemed like a great app. However there was no way to block the phone apps yet still allowing calling. Not even emergency calls. I don't like my child to not be able to call if they need something.,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"The start/stop functions do not work. When you send a task, it says sent but nothing happens. Troubleshooting says fix timezone but button doesn't work.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I didn't want to overly control the use of the Tablets my children use just to ration their usage.  App works brilliantly and the option to send chores via the remote app is brilliant.  Nice app!,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"It took a while to get working properly, mainly down to user error but now it is it's brilliant!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This is a great app for time control, however more features would be nice such as blocking apps or even being able to set time limits on individual apps or perhaps exclude apps from the time limit all together.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Limits the time my children are on ""non-educational"" games.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Like this app a lot.  Glad i can control my sons time on his cell phone and his tablet and see what games he's playing.  But the newest update to control time from the parents device to the child's device is not working properly for our devices.  I still have to go on their devices to set the time and restrictions.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Good App, especially for older teens.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Well done!  Exactly what we needed.  World be nice to be able to allow our kids to download apps but not be able to use them until we've approved them and added then to Screen Time.   Would also be great to have an option to disallow certain apps entirely.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,It's only free for 2 weeks! This sucks!,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excellent,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I've only been testing it for a week, but so far it seems to be doing just what I was hoping for.  Even allows me to add tasks like cutting the grass for more play time!! Still trying to see how easy it is to defeat the security.    But I guess I'm eventually going to un-install it since it's a subscription service rather than a free or one time purchase.  I'd gladly pay 5, 10 or even 20 dollars for the app.  But not 2 dollars a month.  That's just wrong.  Looks like I'll be looking for something similar with a little bit better business model.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Looks very promising, hope it would go by android device Id or something in the near future...",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Worked great the 1st 2 days then taskes disappeared and everytime I tried tomrefresh, it said couldn't connect.",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Nicely executed so far, but some bugs still: new tasks  created on remote control app don't show up in the child's  task list until a day later, even though notification of a new task having been created shows up on the tablet within seconds. Also, would be useful to have more than one parent able to control from different Google accounts.",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Always coming out with updates that add useful features.  I use the task feature to help my kids keep their priorities straight, earning extra time for doing daily devotions or being able to lock it until homework is done.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I never got a chance to use this application as I waited for about one month before support for restricted accounts was added. I was excited to finely use it, only to find out that there was a trial period. I almost clicked buy it until I saw it was a monthly fee. Asking for $2 a month is a joke just to remotely manage the client app. If this was a onetime purchase like the majority of apps, I'd buy it. Don't offer an app as free and hide a monthly charge to use it. Put a paid version out there separately.",2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Love this app! Only question or suggestion I have is does it have a safe web browsing feature?,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,You have to pay for it.,2
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,My kids are finally doing more than playing on there devices!  It says only a 14 day free trial but how much does it cost after that?,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Suks,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Love the concept. The only thing is I've created a parent google account so my husband and I could share the google account. I thought by doing this and putting the google account into our Childs master parent account on his phone, once we downloaded the remote to both our phones we could use that same google account to both monitor but my phone is the only one connecting and it won't connect with thr parent email i created and put on my childs phone it only connects when i use my personal mail",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,The best timer for my kids tablets. They will actually do their homework so they can play games. Would recommend this app to any parent with children old enough to talk back.,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Kept crash... no feedback...,1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"This app is useless. Does not allow me to extend time for my son from my phone since its the weekend. It keeps saying it went through, but nothing happens.",1
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,I tried to extend my child's time by 1 hour today and it only extended by about 3 minutes.  I tried it again and it did the same thing.  This is the first time I've tried to use this feature so I'm not sure if it's an ongoing issue.  Love the app otherwise as well as the main one.  Only suggestion for the R.C. app is that the extension times are too broad. I'd rather be able to just type in a time myself rather than click a radio button or at least add a 2-hour option.,3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I love the parental control app, but I'm having issues with the remote control part. It is Saturday and I wanted to give my son an extra hour on the tablet. I tried to ""send it"" from my phone with a sweet little message and nothing came through. It continued to show that the limit had been reached. We tried refreshing, I tried resending twice, it said it had been sent but nothing happened. I ended up having to go into the tablet app, unlocking the app with my password, and increasing the limit. Can you fix?",3
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Good app. Can you have a blocking option so restricting play store is possbile ?,4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"Simple, well designed and well executed. Gives me the information and control I need to effectively manage my sons screen time.  Would echo the curfew requirement and ability to change app listing remotely but other than that it does just what I need.",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Excelente aplicación,5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I was really impressed with the original 'Screen Time Parental Control' control app that this developer built, and this remote control app takes it to a new level. The features are SO useful, letting me see on my tablet exactly how much time they've been playing on their tablets (we have 3 kids!) but also the ability to force a screen break when dinner is ready or we're trying to leave the house. You can even remove the limits remotely as a reward for finishing their homework or if they have friends come over.  This app really does save me so much time that i used to spend nagging my kids to get off their tablets and trying to keep track of how much time they had spent on them. The monthly subscription really does pay for itself when you consider how much time you save and makes it all much less stressful for you and your kids.  Thank you Screen Time Labs - keep up the good work!",5
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,"I have 2 children and on their phones the app is working fine. on the contrary the remote isnt able to calculate the correct time for each of the 2 children. For the 1st today count is 7 hours and only 30 minutes for the 2nd which is wrong checking the apps on their phones. Android 4.0.4 - galaxy tab2 7'. I noticed there have been updates and i updated all 3 apps today. Keep up the good work. App is really nice EDIT thx, i'll check it asap to see if everything is working .. thumbs up :)",4
com.screentime.rc,A Google user,Downloaded this yesterday as we have 2 children using Screen Time on their tablets. Now I can check up on their tablet time from my phone from anywhere. I hope there are more features to come - being able to make changes to daily limits would be very useful. Top marks!,5
